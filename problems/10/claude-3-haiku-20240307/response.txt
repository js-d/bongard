Let's take a closer look at the images in the left group and the right group, and describe each one in detail.

Left group:
1. The image shows a simple black equilateral triangle.
2. The image shows an irregular, jagged black shape that resembles the outline of a wolf or some other animal.
3. The image shows a black isosceles triangle with a sharp point at the top.
4. The image shows a black shape with a serrated or wavy outline, resembling a mountain or an irregular polygon.
5. The image shows a simple black downward-pointing triangle.
6. The image shows a black shape with a jagged, irregular outline that resembles a lightning bolt or a combination of sharp angles.

Right group:
1. The image shows a simple black square.
2. The image shows a black shape with a wavy, serrated outline that resembles a rectangular frame or border.
3. The image shows a black shape with a jagged, irregular outline that resembles a lightning bolt or a combination of sharp angles.
4. The image shows a black shape with a wavy, serrated outline that resembles a rectangular frame or border.
5. The image shows a black shape with a jagged, irregular outline that resembles a lightning bolt or a combination of sharp angles.
6. The image shows a black shape with a diamond-like outline, with sharp points at the top and bottom.

The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group is the overall shape and symmetry of the objects depicted. The images in the left group predominantly feature irregular, jagged, and asymmetrical shapes, such as triangles, lightning bolts, and animal outlines. In contrast, the images in the right group feature more regular, symmetrical shapes, such as squares, rectangles, and diamonds.

Additionally, the shapes in the left group appear to be more dynamic and organic, with a sense of movement or energy, while the shapes in the right group are more static and geometric.

The difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the left group contains irregular, asymmetrical shapes, such as jagged triangles and animal-like outlines, while the right group contains more regular, symmetrical shapes, such as squares, rectangles, and diamonds. The shapes in the left group also appear more dynamic and organic, with a sense of movement or energy, while the shapes in the right group are more static and geometric.
