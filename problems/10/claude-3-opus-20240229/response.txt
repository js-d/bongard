Left group:
1. A black equilateral triangle with a hollow interior, rendered in a pixelated style.
2. A pixelated black outline of a roughly triangular shape, but with a jagged, uneven right side.
3. A small solid black equilateral triangle.
4. A jagged pixelated black shape resembling a three-sided star or zig-zag, symmetrical in shape.
5. A hollow black equilateral triangle, rendered with minimal pixelation.
6. A jagged, roughly triangular shape made of black pixels, with an opening on the left side.

Right group:
1. A black square outline with a white/hollow interior.
2. A hollow rectangle made of small black square pixels, with a jagged/zig-zag right side.
3. A hollow diamond shape made of black pixels.
4. An irregular jagged outline made of black pixels, roughly forming a closed diamond-like shape.
5. A hollow diamond shape made of smooth, connected black lines.
6. A hollow square with black outlines.

The left group all contains triangular shapes or shapes made of three sides/points, while the right group contains shapes with four sides - rectangles, squares, and diamonds. The left shapes are generally pointing upward, while many of the right shapes have a horizontal or diamond orientation.

The pixelation and style varies between individual images in each group, with some having smooth lines and others having jagged pixelated edges. But the key unifying trait seems to be triangles on the left, and quadrilaterals on the right.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is:
The left group images all contain triangular shapes with three sides or points, while the right group images contain quadrilateral shapes with four sides, such as squares, rectangles and diamonds.
