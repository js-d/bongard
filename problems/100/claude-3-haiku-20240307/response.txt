2. The image shows a capital letter 'Z' formed by black pixels against a white background.
3. The image shows a capital letter 'J' formed by black pixels against a white background.
4. The image shows a capital letter 'A' formed by black pixels against a white background, but the shape is slightly different from the first 'A' image.
5. The image shows a capital letter 'A' formed by black pixels against a white background, with a slightly different shape compared to the previous 'A' images.
6. The image shows a capital letter 'A' formed by black pixels against a white background, with a unique shape that is different from the previous 'A' images.

Analyzing the right group of images:

1. The image shows a capital letter 'O' formed by black pixels against a white background.
2. The image shows a capital letter 'D' formed by black pixels against a white background.
3. The image shows a capital letter 'B' formed by black pixels against a white background.

<answer>
The key difference between the left group and the right group of images is that the left group consists of six different images of the capital letter 'A', while the right group consists of various other capital letters, such as 'O', 'D', 'B', 'E', and 'G'. All the images in both groups are formed by black pixels against a white background, but the specific letters represented differ between the two groups.
