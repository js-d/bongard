To analyze the 12 images and describe the differences between the left and right groups, I will first examine each image in detail.

Left group:
1. The image shows a diamond-shaped figure with sharp, pointed edges.
2. The image shows a triangular figure with a sharp point at the top and a flat base.
3. The image shows a curved, crescent-shaped figure with a pointed tip on the left side.
4. The image shows a long, narrow figure with a pointed tip on the left side.
5. The image shows a rectangular figure with a smaller rectangle cut out of the center.
6. The image shows a jagged, lightning bolt-shaped figure with multiple sharp angles.

Right group:
1. The image shows a perfect circle.
2. The image shows a regular hexagon.
3. The image shows a square.
4. The image shows a circle with a smaller circle cut out of the center.
5. The image shows a circle with a square cut out of the center.
6. The image shows a perfect circle.

Analyzing the differences between the two groups, I can see that the left group contains figures with sharp, angular, and irregular shapes, while the right group contains regular, geometric shapes like circles, squares, and hexagons.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is that the left group contains figures with sharp, irregular shapes, while the right group contains regular, geometric shapes.

The left group contains figures like diamonds, triangles, crescents, and jagged lightning bolt shapes, all of which have sharp, pointed angles and irregular, asymmetrical forms. In contrast, the right group contains perfect circles, regular hexagons, squares, and other simple geometric shapes that are symmetrical and lack the sharp, irregular edges of the left group.
