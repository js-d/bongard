Left group:
1. A thin, elongated diamond shape made up of black pixels on a white background.
2. An elongated hexagon shape made up of black pixels, with the longer sides on the top and bottom.
3. A curved shape resembling a backwards "C" made up of black pixels.
4. An elongated oval shape made up of black pixels, slightly thicker on the left side.
5. A thin, perfectly horizontal rectangle made up of black pixels.
6. A curved arc shape made up of black pixels, with a short horizontal line extending from the right end.

Right group:
1. A perfect circle made up of black pixels.
2. A perfect hexagon shape made up of black pixels.
3. A small, solid square made up of black pixels.
4. A perfectly square outline made up of black pixels, with white space inside.
5. A small, solid circular shape made up of black pixels.
6. A thin, perfectly circular outline made up of black pixels, with white space inside.

<thinking>
The left group contains irregular, asymmetric, and open shapes. The right group contains regular, symmetric, and mostly closed shapes like circles, hexagons, and squares.
The shapes in the left group are more elongated and curved, while the shapes in the right group are more compact and angular.
The left group has a mix of thin lines and thicker shapes, while the right group mostly has thin outlines or small solid shapes.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the left group contains irregular, asymmetric, and open shapes that are more elongated and curved, while the right group contains regular, symmetric, and mostly closed shapes that are more compact and angular. The left group has a mix of thin lines and thicker shapes, while the right group mostly has thin outlines or small solid shapes.
