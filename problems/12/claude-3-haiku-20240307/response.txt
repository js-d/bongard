To analyze the images and explain the difference between the left and right groups, I will carefully examine each image and make observations about their key features.

Left group:
1. This image shows a long, straight, diagonal line with a zigzag pattern along its length.
2. This image depicts an elongated oval shape with a wavy, uneven outline.
3. This image shows a single, vertical line with a slight curve at the bottom.
4. This image displays a jagged, irregular line with multiple angles and bends.
5. This image presents a simple vertical line with a single, sharp bend in the middle.
6. This image shows a series of connected, pointed peaks, creating a wave-like pattern.

Right group:
1. This image depicts a complete circle with a solid, uniform outline.
2. This image shows a circular shape with an inner concentric ring, creating a layered effect.
3. This image presents a square-shaped frame with no internal details.
4. This image displays a five-pointed star with sharp, angular points.
5. This image shows a complex, interconnected pattern of rectangular and angular shapes.
6. This image depicts a single, diamond-shaped shape with a solid, uniform outline.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the left group images all feature irregular, wavy, or jagged shapes, while the right group images all feature regular, geometric shapes.

The left group images depict abstract, organic shapes with varying degrees of complexity and asymmetry, such as diagonal lines, elongated ovals, and wave-like patterns. In contrast, the right group images feature simple, uniform shapes like circles, squares, stars, and diamonds, which have a more geometric, structured appearance.

Additionally, the images in the left group seem to have a more dynamic, flowing quality, while the right group images have a more static, rigid quality.
