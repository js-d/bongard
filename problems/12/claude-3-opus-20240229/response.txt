Left group:
1. A thin, elongated rectangle or oval shape made up of black pixels on a white background.
2. An elongated oval or elliptical shape made up of black pixels, with a small gap or break in the center of the shape.
3. A small black oval shape, slightly tilted or angled, on a white background.
4. A jagged, zig-zag line consisting of several connected line segments at alternating angles, resembling a simplified depiction of a lightning bolt.
5. A thin, vertical black rectangle on a white background.
6. A jagged, zig-zag pattern consisting of three connected chevron or arrow-like shapes pointing to the right.

Right group:
1. A black circular or oval shape with a small rectangular notch or gap on the left side.
2. A black outline of a spiral or snail shell-like shape, starting with a small inner loop and expanding outward in a clockwise direction.
3. A black outline of a square or rectangular shape with a small square gap or notch on the bottom edge.
4. A black eight-pointed star shape, resembling two overlapping or intersecting crosses at different angles.
5. A black outline of a stylized letter "H", with the vertical lines slightly offset and not connected at the top and bottom.
6. A black outline of a diamond or rhombus shape.

The main difference between the left and right groups seems to be that the shapes in the left group are mostly solid black shapes or lines, while the shapes in the right group are outlines or hollow shapes with an internal gap or space.

The left group contains simple geometric shapes like ovals, rectangles, and zig-zag lines, as well as a few more complex shapes like the lightning bolt and the jagged arrow pattern.

In contrast, the right group has more varied and intricate outline shapes, such as a spiral, a star, a stylized letter, and a diamond. These shapes have a gap or empty space within the outline.

So in summary, the key difference is:
Left group: Solid black shapes and lines
Right group: Outline shapes with gaps or empty spaces inside
