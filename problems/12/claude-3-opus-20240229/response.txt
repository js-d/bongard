Left group:
1. A single diagonal line segment, sloping down from left to right.
2. A single curved line, concave up, with the left end higher than the right.
3. A single vertical line segment.
4. A single curved line, concave down, with the left end lower than the right.
5. A single vertical line segment, shorter in length than image 3.
6. Three connected shorter line segments in a zig-zag pattern, resembling a simplified ECG heartbeat waveform.

Right group:
1. A single circle outline, not filled in.
2. A curved line, concave down, connecting to a small circle at its right end point.
3. A single unfilled square outline.
4. An 8-pointed star shape outline, formed by overlapping two square outlines rotated 45 degrees apart.
5. A 6-sided polygon outline in the style of a house floor plan, with 3 segments comprising the "roof" and 3 the "base".
6. A single diamond shape outline.

The left group images all consist of only lines or line segments, either straight, curved, or connected. None of them form closed shapes.

In contrast, the right group images all contain closed shape outlines like circles, squares, polygons, or curved lines that connect end to end.

So the key differentiating factor seems to be the presence of closed shape outlines in the right group, while the left group has only open lines and curves.

<answer>
The images in the left group contain only open lines or curves, without any closed shapes. The images in the right group all feature closed shape outlines like circles, squares, stars, and other polygons.
