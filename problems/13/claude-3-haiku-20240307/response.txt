To analyze the images, I will examine each one in the left and right groups, describing the key features and differences I observe.

Left group:
1. A simple black rectangular frame.
2. A simple black oval shape.
3. A simple black rectangular frame with a smaller black rectangular shape inside it.
4. A simple black oval shape.
5. A simple black oval shape.
6. A simple black rectangular shape.

Right group:
1. A simple black oval shape.
2. A simple black rectangular frame.
3. A simple black rectangular shape.
4. A simple black oval shape with a smaller black oval shape inside it.
5. A simple black oval shape.
6. A simple black rectangular shape with a smaller rectangular shape inside it.

The key difference I notice between the left and right groups is the presence of additional internal shapes within some of the images in the right group, while the images in the left group are all simple, single shapes without any internal elements.

<answer>
The images in the left group are all simple, single shapes without any internal elements - just a rectangle, oval, or rectangle with a smaller rectangle inside. In contrast, the images in the right group have additional internal shapes within some of the frames, such as a smaller oval or rectangle inside the main shape.
