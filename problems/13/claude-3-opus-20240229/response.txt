Left group:
1. A vertically oriented rectangle outline.
2. A hollow oval shape.
3. A vertical rectangle with a smaller horizontal rectangle attached to the left side, forming an "L" shape.
4. A hollow oval or elliptical shape with a gap or disconnection at the bottom.
5. Another similar hollow oval shape with a gap at the bottom.
6. A vertical rectangle with a small square attached to the top left side.

Right group:
1. A continuous, unbroken oval outline.
2. A horizontal rectangle with a vertical gap or separation on the right side.
3. Two separate ovals, one above the other, not connected.
4. A horizontal rectangle with a small square gap in the bottom edge.
5. A single oval with a portion of the outline missing at the top, creating an opening.
6. A horizontal rectangle with a small square gap in the top edge.

<thinking>
The left group contains shapes that are either composed of multiple disconnected parts or have gaps/openings in their outlines. The rectangles have smaller shapes attached to them.
The right group has more singular, whole shapes. The ovals are continuous or only have a single gap. The rectangles have small gaps within them rather than shapes attached.
The key difference seems to be that the left shapes are made of multiple parts or have multiple gaps, while the right shapes are singular or have at most one gap.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the shapes in the left group are either composed of multiple disconnected parts or have multiple gaps or openings in their outlines. In contrast, the shapes in the right group are more singular, continuous shapes that have at most one gap or opening.
