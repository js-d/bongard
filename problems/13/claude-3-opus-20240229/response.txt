Left group:
1. A vertical rectangle with rounded corners.
2. A circle enclosed within rounded rectangle boundaries.
3. Two rectangles, one inside the other. The outer rectangle has rounded corners while the inner one has sharp corners.
4. An oval or elliptical shape.
5. Two ovals/ellipses, one inside the other.
6. A rectangle with sharp corners.

Right group:
1. An oval or elliptical shape.
2. An incomplete rectangular shape, open on the left side. The other corners are sharp/pointed.
3. An open oval/elliptical shape.
4. An incomplete rectangular shape with pointed corners, open at the top and bottom.
5. An open oval/elliptical shape, with a gap on the left side.
6. Two incomplete rectangles with sharp corners, one inside the other. Both are open on the right side.

<thinking>
- The left group contains complete, enclosed shapes. The right group has shapes that are open or incomplete.
- Shapes in the left group alternate between rounded rectangles and ovals/ellipses. The right group alternates between ovals/ellipses and rectangles with sharp corners.
- When shapes are nested in the left group, both the inner and outer shapes are complete. In the right group, when shapes are nested, they are both open/incomplete.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the shapes in the left group are all complete and fully enclosed, while the shapes in the right group are open or incomplete. The left group contains alternating rounded rectangles and ovals/ellipses, and when shapes are nested, both the inner and outer shapes are complete. In contrast, the right group alternates between ovals/ellipses and rectangles with sharp corners, and when shapes are nested, they are both open or incomplete.
