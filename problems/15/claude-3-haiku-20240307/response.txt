Analyzing the 12 images, I notice that the left group consists of 6 images with different shapes that appear to be irregular or asymmetrical. The right group also has 6 images, but these shapes seem to be more symmetrical or regular in nature.

Let me describe each image in detail:

Left group:
1. An elongated oval shape with a slightly jagged edge.
2. A shape resembling an irregular pentagon or a flattened semicircle.
3. A wavy, curved shape with a more pronounced contour.
4. A shape that resembles a distorted bell or a lopsided arch.
5. A shape with two bulbous protrusions, creating an asymmetrical appearance.
6. A rectangular shape with an uneven, jagged edge on one side.

Right group:
1. A shape resembling an upright heart or a rounded U-shape.
2. A simple, circular shape.
3. A triangular shape with a straight base and a pointed top.
4. A shape that resembles a pointed arrow or a triangle with one side curved.
5. A shape that appears to be a simplified, angular version of the left group's fourth image.
6. A spiral or coiled shape, with a symmetrical, regular pattern.

Based on the observations, the key difference between the left and right groups seems to be the level of symmetry or regularity in the shapes. The left group images have more irregular, asymmetrical shapes, while the right group images have more symmetrical, regular shapes.
