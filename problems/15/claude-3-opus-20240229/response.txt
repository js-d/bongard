Left group:
1. An elliptical shape made up of black pixels on a white background.
2. A shape resembling a sideways "D" or a semi-ellipse, made of black pixels on a white background.
3. An S-shaped curve made of connected black pixels on a white background.
4. A curved shape resembling a backwards "C", made of black pixels on a white background.
5. A shape made of two connected ellipses or circular shapes, resembling a sideways "8" or infinity symbol, made of black pixels on a white background.
6. A rectangular shape made of black pixels on a white background.

Right group:
1. A circular shape with a smaller circular cutout in the center, resembling a donut shape, made of black pixels on a white background.
2. A circular shape made of black pixels on a white background.
3. An angular, zigzag-like shape made of connected black pixels resembling a lightning bolt or the letter "Z", on a white background.
4. A triangular shape made of black pixels, with one of the corners extending out further than the others, on a white background.
5. A shape resembling a greater-than sign (">") or an arrowhead pointing to the right, made of black pixels on a white background.
6. A spiral or snail shell-like shape made of a curved line of black pixels, circling inward in a clockwise direction on a white background.

<thinking>
The key difference between the left and right groups seems to be whether the shapes have a hole or a fully enclosed area. The shapes in the left group are all made of continuous lines or curves without any holes or enclosed spaces. The shapes on the right all contain a fully enclosed area, either in the shape itself like the donut and circle, or an area enclosed by the lines like in the spiral, arrowhead, and zigzag.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and right group is that the shapes in the left group are all open-ended lines or curves that do not enclose any space, while the shapes in the right group all contain an enclosed area, either within the shape itself or by the shape's lines enclosing an area of the background.
