Left group:
1. A black spiral shape curling inwards counterclockwise, with the end of the spiral in the center.
2. A black spiral shape curling inwards counterclockwise, with a small black circle in the center where the spiral ends.
3. A black incomplete spiral shape curling inwards counterclockwise, with a straight line jutting out from the end towards the top left.
4. A black incomplete squared spiral shape, with the outer lines at right angles curling inwards counterclockwise, and the center a small black square.
5. A black spiral shape curling inwards counterclockwise, with a small black circle in the center and an incomplete outer ring.
6. A black spiral shape made of two curved lines curling inwards counterclockwise, with an empty center.

Right group:
1. A black spiral shape curling inwards clockwise, with the end of the spiral in the center.
2. A black squared spiral shape, with the lines at right angles curling inwards clockwise to a center point.
3. A black squared spiral shape, with the outer lines at right angles curling inwards clockwise, and the center a small pentagon shape.
4. A black spiral shape curling inwards clockwise, with a small circle in the center and an incomplete outer ring.
5. A black incomplete triangle spiral shape, with the lines curling inwards clockwise and the innermost shape a triangle pointing up.
6. A black squared spiral shape, with the lines at right angles curling inwards clockwise, and an incomplete outer square.

<thinking>
The key differences I notice between the left and right groups are:
- The spirals in the left group all curl counterclockwise, while the spirals in the right group all curl clockwise.
- The left group contains more rounded, curved spiral shapes, while the right group has more squared, angular spiral shapes with the lines at right angles.
- A few spirals in each group have a small shape in the center where the spiral ends - a circle in the left group, and a circle, pentagon or triangle in the right group.
- Some spirals in each group have an incomplete or partial outer shape around the spiral.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group versus the right group is the direction the spirals curl. In the left group, all the spirals curl inwards in a counterclockwise direction. In the right group, all the spirals curl inwards in a clockwise direction. 
Additionally, the left group spirals tend to be more rounded and curved, while the right group has more squared, angular spirals with the lines at right angles.
