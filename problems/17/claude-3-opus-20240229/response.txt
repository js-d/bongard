Left group:
1. A single curved line that resembles a crescent moon shape or a partial circle.
2. Two curved lines that form an incomplete oval or eye shape, with the lines nearly meeting at the top and bottom.
3. The letter "N" in a jagged, pixelated font, composed of straight lines that resemble digital building blocks.
4. A curved line that starts thin on the left side, thickens in the middle, and tapers to a point on the right side, resembling a curved arrow pointing right.
5. A thin rectangular shape with protrusions resembling arrow points on the left and right sides, pointing inward to create a very narrow hourglass-like shape.
6. Two identical oval shapes that touch in the middle, resembling the infinity symbol or a figure 8 turned on its side.

Right group:
1. A thin, pixelated rectangular shape, resembling a low resolution image of a house with a triangular roof.
2. A crescent moon shape with a thin rectangular shape attached to the concave side of the crescent, resembling a small house or hut with the crescent as the roof.
3. A very thin, straight vertical line with short, thin horizontal lines extending to the left and right from the top and bottom of the vertical line, resembling a capital letter "I" with serifs.
4. A thin, angular shape resembling a backwards capital letter "L", with the vertical line on the right and the horizontal line extending to the left from the top of the vertical line.
5. A rectangular shape with a bite taken out of the top right corner, resembling the shape of the state of Utah or a ticket stub with one corner missing.
6. A thin circular shape, resembling a capital letter "O" or a zero in a pixelated font.

The images in the left group all have curved lines or shapes, while the images in the right group are composed mainly of straight lines and angular shapes. This seems to be the main distinguishing factor between the two groups.

The left group contains more organic, smooth, and flowing shapes like crescents, ovals, and the infinity symbol, while the right group has more rigid, geometric, and pixelated shapes that resemble simple icons, letters, or basic images.

Another potential difference is that the shapes in the left group are generally connected or continuous (with the exception of image 3), while many of the shapes in the right group have distinct, unconnected parts like the house with a separate roof, the "I" with detached serifs, and the "L" shape.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the left group contains curved, smooth, organic shapes, while the right group consists of straight-lined, angular, geometric shapes. The shapes in the left group flow continuously, while many shapes in the right group have separate, unconnected elements.
