Left group:
1. A bowtie-shaped figure made up of two triangles connected at their points.
2. An hourglass-like shape formed by two triangles connected at a single point, one pointing up and the other down.
3. An arrow-like shape pointing to the right, made of a small triangle attached to a larger triangle.
4. A curved shape resembling a squashed infinity symbol or a sideways figure-8, made of two oval-like shapes connected in the middle.
5. A curved shape like a backwards question mark without the dot, or a curved tadpole shape.
6. A curved shape resembling a kidney bean or a comma.

Right group:
1. A rectangular shape made of two long thin rectangles.
2. An L-shaped figure made of two perpendicular rectangles, one vertical and one horizontal.
3. An oval or egg-like shape made of a single curved line.
4. A curved crescent moon-like shape, thicker on one end and tapering on the other.
5. A curved shape resembling a backwards C or a sideways parenthesis "(" symbol.
6. A spiral or snail shell-like shape curving in a circular clockwise direction.

<thinking>
The left group contains shapes made up of straight lines and angles, forming triangular or arrow-like shapes. Even the curved shapes are made of two distinct parts.

The right group contains shapes dominated by curves and rounded edges. They form oval, circular, or smoothly curved figures without sharp angles.

The key difference seems to be that the left group is characterized by shapes with straight lines and angles, while the right group features smooth, curved shapes without angles.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and right group is that the left group contains shapes made up of straight lines and angles, forming triangular, arrow-like, or connected shapes, while the right group features smooth, continuously curved shapes without sharp angles, resembling ovals, crescents, spirals, and rounded figures.
