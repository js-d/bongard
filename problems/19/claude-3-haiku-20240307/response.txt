To describe the images in the left group:

Left group:
1. The image shows a simple line drawing of a wave-like shape, with two distinct peaks and troughs.
2. This image depicts a more complex wave-like shape, with multiple peaks and troughs.
3. The shape in this image is similar to the previous ones, but it has a more jagged and irregular appearance, with a sharper peak and a more pronounced trough.
4. This image shows a shape that is more elongated and rounded, with a single, smooth curve.
5. The shape in this image is similar to the previous one, but it has a more pronounced and angular appearance, with a sharper peak and a more pronounced trough.
6. This image depicts a shape that is more compact and rounded, with a single, smooth curve.

To describe the images in the right group:

Right group:
1. The image shows a simple line drawing of a shape that resembles a person sitting or resting.
2. This image depicts a shape that is more complex and abstract, with a rounded, curved outline that suggests a bird or some other organic form.
3. The shape in this image is similar to the previous one, but it is more angular and geometric, with a more distinct and pronounced outline.
4. This image shows a shape that is more elongated and sinuous, with a curved outline that suggests a snake or a worm.
5. The shape in this image is similar to the previous one, but it is more compact and rounded, with a more distinct and pronounced outline.
6. This image depicts a shape that is more complex and abstract, with a curved outline that suggests a cloud or some other natural formation.

To explain the difference between the two groups:

The images in the left group all depict simple, wave-like shapes with varying degrees of complexity and irregularity. In contrast, the images in the right group depict more complex, abstract shapes that suggest organic or natural forms, such as a person, a bird, a snake, or a cloud. The shapes in the right group also tend to be more elongated and sinuous, with a greater variety of curves and angles, compared to the more uniform and symmetrical wave-like shapes in the left group.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is that the left group depicts simple, wave-like shapes, while the right group depicts more complex, abstract shapes that suggest organic or natural forms.

The images in the left group are all variations on a basic wave-like shape, with varying degrees of complexity and irregularity. In contrast, the images in the right group depict a much wider range of shapes, including a person sitting or resting, a bird or other organic form, a snake or worm, and a cloud or other natural formation. These shapes are more complex and abstract, with a greater variety of curves and angles, compared to the more uniform and symmetrical wave-like shapes in the left group.
