Left group:
1. A barbell-shaped object comprised of two curved segments connected by a straight line segment in the middle.
2. Similar to image 1, but the barbell shape is rotated 90 degrees.
3. Barbell shape with an additional curved segment extending from the left end, resulting in 3 curved segments total.
4. Barbell shape but with the curved segments spiraling inward to form a cursive "S" like shape.
5. Similar cursive "S" shape as image 4, but reflected horizontally.
6. A more complex curved shape resembling a rotated lowercase "h", formed by connecting 4 curved segments.

Right group:
1. A shape resembling a rotated uppercase "L", formed by a curved segment connected to a straight line segment pointing upwards.
2. Similar to a backwards "L" shape, but with an additional curved segment connected to the top, resulting in 3 segments total.
3. A curved shape resembling a backwards lowercase "j".
4. Three curved segments connected to form a closed loop, resembling a kidney bean shape.
5. Similar kidney bean shape as image 4, but with the bottom half reflected to extend downwards.
6. A curved branching shape, with the main curved segment splitting into two shorter curved segments pointing in opposite directions.

<thinking>
The left group all contains shapes based on a barbell-like structure with two mirrored curved segments connected by a straight segment. Additional curved segments are added in various configurations to create more complex shapes, but the base symmetrical structure is maintained.

In contrast, the right group contains asymmetrical curved shapes. They often feature a straight segment with one or more curved segments branching off to a single side. The shapes tend to be open-ended rather than closed loops. A key difference is the lack of left-right symmetry that was present in the left group.

<answer>
The main difference between the two groups is that the shapes in the left group are all based on a symmetrical barbell-like structure, with equal curved segments on both sides connected by a straight segment. The shapes in the right group are asymmetrical, with curved segments branching off to one side from a straight segment, and lacking the left-right mirror symmetry seen in the left group.
