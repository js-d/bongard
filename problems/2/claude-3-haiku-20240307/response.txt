Let's analyze the images in detail:

Left group:
1. The image shows a black triangular shape with a jagged or uneven outline.
2. The image shows a black shape resembling the profile of an animal's head, with a large protrusion on the top.
3. The image shows a black crescent or curved shape with a jagged or uneven outline.
4. The image shows a black circular shape.
5. The image shows a black shape resembling an arrow or chevron, pointing to the left.
6. The image shows a black irregular or amorphous shape, with a large protrusion on the top.

Right group:
1. The image is completely blank or white.
2. The image shows a small black square or rectangle shape.
3. The image shows a small black shape resembling the letter 'M'.
4. The image shows a small black triangular shape.
5. The image shows a small black circular shape.
6. The image shows a small black shape resembling the letter 'H'.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group are larger and more complex, with distinct shapes and irregular outlines, while the images in the right group are smaller and more simple, with basic geometric shapes.
