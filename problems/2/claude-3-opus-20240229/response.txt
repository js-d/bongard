Left group:
1. A black triangle made up of pixel-like squares.
2. A black, roughly circular shape made up of pixel-like squares.
3. A black, roughly semi-circular shape made up of pixel-like squares, with a triangular protrusion on the flat side.
4. A black, roughly circular shape made up of pixel-like squares, with a small square cut out.
5. A black, roughly L-shaped polygon made up of pixel-like squares.
6. A black, roughly hexagonal shape made up of pixel-like squares.

Right group:
1. A single black pixel-like square.
2. A black, vertical rectangular shape made up of two pixel-like squares stacked on top of each other.
3. A black, triangular shape made up of three pixel-like squares arranged in a triangle pointing upward.
4. A single black, circular pixel.
5. A black, hook-like shape made up of three pixel-like squares arranged in an L-shape rotated 180 degrees.
6. A black H-shape made up of four pixel-like squares.

The left group contains larger, more complex shapes made up of multiple pixel-like squares, while the right group contains simpler shapes and patterns comprised of fewer pixel-like squares or single circular pixels.

The shapes in the left group appear to be attempting to approximate curved and irregular shapes using the pixel-like building blocks, resulting in rough edges and imperfect shapes. The right group uses the pixel-like squares to create smaller, cleaner geometric shapes and patterns.

The key difference seems to be that the left group is focused on creating larger, more organic and complex forms, while the right group consists of minimal, stylized shapes and symbols. The left group shapes are made up of more components and appear "messy", while the right group shapes are made of fewer components arranged in precise ways.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the left group images contain larger, more complex irregular shapes constructed from many pixel-like squares, while the right group images feature simpler, cleaner, smaller-scale geometric shapes and symbols made up of fewer pixel components. The left group approximates curved organic forms with rough edges, whereas the right group creates precise, minimal patterns and shapes.
