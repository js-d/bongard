Left group:
1. A black outline of a triangle with no fill.
2. A filled in black irregular shape that looks like a piece broken off of something.
3. A black outline of an irregular angular shape, like a piece broken off of something, with no fill.
4. A black outline of a circle with a piece missing, like a circular cookie with a bite taken out of it.
5. A black angular shape outline, resembling an arrow pointing left, with no fill.
6. A filled in black hexagonal shape.

Right group:
1. A tiny black square.
2. A black crown-like shape.
3. A small filled in black triangle pointing up.
4. A small filled in black circle.
5. A small question mark shape.
6. A black X shape.

<thinking>
The left group images are all:
- Relatively large
- Mostly outlines or silhouettes of shapes
- The shapes are incomplete, like pieces of a whole or with parts missing
- Irregular and angular shapes

The right group images are:
- Very small, like punctuation marks or symbols
- Fully filled in black shapes, no outlines
- Complete, whole shapes 
- Simple geometric shapes or recognizable symbols

The key difference seems to be that the left images are incomplete pieces or outlines of larger irregular shapes, while the right images are tiny, complete, filled-in simple shapes or symbols.

<answer>
The images in the left group are all outlines or silhouettes of incomplete, irregular angular shapes that look like pieces of a larger whole. The images in the right group are all very small, fully filled-in, complete shapes that are either simple geometric forms or recognizable symbols and punctuation marks.
