To describe the images in the left group:

Left group:
1. This image contains a black triangle pointing downwards and a small black circle above it.
2. This image contains a black triangle pointing upwards and a small black circle to the left of it.
3. This image contains two black triangles pointing in opposite directions, with a small black circle between them.
4. This image contains a large black triangle pointing downwards and a small black triangle pointing upwards within it.
5. This image contains a large black circle and a smaller black triangle pointing downwards within it.
6. This image contains a large black circle and a smaller black triangle pointing upwards within it.

To describe the images in the right group:

Right group:
1. This image contains a large black circle and a smaller black triangle pointing downwards to the right of it.
2. This image contains a large black circle and a smaller black triangle pointing downwards below it.
3. This image contains a large black circle.
4. This image contains two black triangles of different sizes, one pointing upwards and the other pointing downwards.
5. This image contains a large black circle and a smaller black triangle pointing downwards to the left of it.
6. This image contains two black circles of different sizes.

To explain the difference between the two groups:

The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group is the presence of additional shapes within the larger shapes in the left group, while the right group only contains the larger shapes without any additional shapes inside them.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group all contain additional shapes nested within the larger shapes, while the images in the right group only contain the larger shapes without any additional shapes inside them.

Specifically:
- In the left group, each image contains a larger shape (either a triangle or a circle) with a smaller shape (either a triangle or a circle) nested within it.
- In the right group, each image contains only the larger shapes (either a triangle or a circle) without any additional shapes inside them.

So the key distinguishing feature between the two groups is the presence or absence of nested, smaller shapes within the larger shapes.
