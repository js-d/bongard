Let's analyze the images in the left group and the right group, and then identify the key differences between them.

Left group:
1. This image contains a circle, a triangle, and a square.
2. This image contains a triangle pointing downwards and a square.
3. This image contains a complex polygon shape and a circle.
4. This image contains a triangle pointing upwards and a circle.
5. This image contains two small circles.
6. This image contains a circle, a square, and a triangle.

Right group:
1. This image contains a triangle pointing upwards and a circle.
2. This image contains a triangle pointing downwards and a square.
3. This image contains several circles and a square.
4. This image contains a triangle pointing upwards and a square.
5. This image contains a circle and a square.
6. This image contains a triangle pointing upwards, a square, and a smaller triangle.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the left group images all contain at least one triangle, while the right group images all contain at least one square. Additionally, the left group images tend to have a more uniform arrangement of shapes, while the right group images have a more varied and asymmetric arrangement of shapes.
