Left group:
1. A black pixelated triangle pointing to the right on a white background.
2. A black pixelated circle on a white background.
3. A black pixelated square on a white background, oriented like a diamond.
4. A black pixelated circle on a white background.
5. A black pixelated plus sign or cross on a white background.
6. A black pixelated rectangle on a white background, oriented horizontally.

Right group:
1. A black pixelated square on a white background, with a small black pixelated circle to its left.
2. A black pixelated square on a white background, with a small black pixelated circle to its right.
3. A black pixelated triangle pointing down on a white background, with a small black pixelated circle above it.
4. A black pixelated circle on a white background, with a smaller black pixelated circle to its upper left and a black pixelated triangle pointing down to its lower right.
5. A black pixelated rectangle on a white background, oriented vertically, with a small black pixelated triangle pointing to the right.
6. A black pixelated circle on a white background, with a smaller black pixelated circle below it.

<thinking>
- The left group contains single black pixelated shapes on white backgrounds
- The right group contains black pixelated shapes on white backgrounds, but each image also includes an additional smaller shape
- The additional smaller shapes in the right group are circles or triangles
- The placement of the additional smaller shapes in the right group varies - sometimes to the left, right, above or below the main shape
</thinking>

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and right group is that the images in the left group each contain a single black pixelated shape on a white background, while the images in the right group each contain a main black pixelated shape along with an additional smaller black pixelated shape (either a circle or triangle). The placement of the additional shapes relative to the main shapes varies across the images in the right group.
