Left group:
1. A square and a circle, not touching each other.
2. Four circles forming the corners of a square, not connected.
3. A square and 3 circles, with the circles at 3 corners of the square but not touching it.
4. Three circles and a square, with the square in the middle and circles at 3 corners not touching the square.
5. Two circles not touching each other.
6. A square, a triangle, and 3 circles, with the shapes spread out and not touching.

Right group:
1. A triangle touching a circle.
2. Two squares, one inside the other and touching on one side.
3. A triangle touching a square.
4. A triangle and 3 squares, with the triangle touching one square.
5. A triangle, a square, and 3 circles, with the triangle touching one circle and the square.
6. A triangle, a square, and 2 circles, with the triangle touching the square and one circle.

<thinking>
The key difference seems to be that in the left group, none of the shapes are touching each other. The shapes are separate and spread out.
In the right group, there is always at least one instance of two shapes touching each other, like a triangle touching a circle or square.
So the distinguishing rule appears to be whether or not any of the shapes are making contact.

<answer>
In the left group, none of the shapes are touching each other. All the shapes are separated and spread out without any contact between them.
In the right group, there is always at least one instance of two shapes touching each other. A shape like a triangle is always in contact with another shape like a circle or square.
