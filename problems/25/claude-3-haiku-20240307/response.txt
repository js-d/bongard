Let me carefully analyze the 12 images and describe them in detail:

Left group:
1. The image consists of 5 geometric shapes: a triangle, a circle, a rectangle, a square, and an irregular shape that resembles a mountain or pyramid.
2. The image shows 4 geometric shapes: 2 circles, a triangle, and a square.
3. The image has 3 shapes: a triangle, a circle, and a rectangle.
4. The image contains 5 shapes: a circle, a triangle, a square, a rectangle, and an irregular shape that looks like a mountain or pyramid.
5. The image displays 3 shapes: a circle, a triangle, and a square.
6. The image has 4 shapes: a circle, a triangle, a square, and a rectangle.

Right group:
1. The image has 3 shapes: a circle, a triangle, and a rectangle.
2. The image consists of 4 shapes: 2 circles, a triangle, and a square.
3. The image shows 5 shapes: a circle, 3 triangles, and a rectangle.
4. The image contains 6 shapes: a circle, 3 triangles, a square, and a rectangle.
5. The image displays 5 shapes: a circle, 3 triangles, and a square.
6. The image has 7 shapes: a circle, 3 triangles, a square, a rectangle, and an irregular shape.

The main difference between the left and right groups is that the left group contains a more diverse set of shapes, including irregular shapes, while the right group primarily consists of circles and triangles, with fewer square and rectangle shapes.

<answer>
The key difference between the left group and the right group is the variety of shapes present. The left group contains a more diverse set of shapes, including irregular shapes like mountains or pyramids, in addition to the basic geometric shapes like circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles. In contrast, the right group is more homogeneous, primarily consisting of circles and triangles, with fewer square and rectangle shapes.
