Left group:
1. Three black shapes: a circle, a square, and a triangle. The circle is at the top, the square is at the bottom right, and the triangle is at the bottom left.
2. Four black circles forming the corners of a square shape.
3. Five black shapes: a triangle at the top, a circle in the middle, two squares at the bottom left and right, and a triangle at the bottom middle.
4. Four black shapes: a square at the top left, a circle at the top right, a triangle at the bottom left, and a square at the bottom right.
5. Four black shapes: a triangle at the top, a circle in the middle, and two triangles at the bottom left and right.
6. Four black shapes: a square at the top left, a circle at the top right, and two circles at the bottom.

Right group:
1. Four black shapes: a circle at the top left, a triangle at the top right, a square in the bottom left, and a triangle at the bottom right.
2. Four black shapes: three circles forming a triangle shape and a black square at the bottom.
3. Five black shapes: a triangle at the top, two circles on the left and right sides, and a square at the bottom left and bottom right.
4. Six black shapes: a triangle at the top, a circle and square in the middle row, and a square, circle, and square in the bottom row.
5. Five black shapes: a square at the top left, two squares in the middle, a circle at the bottom right, and a triangle at the bottom middle.
6. Five black shapes: two circles at the top, a triangle in the middle, and a square at the bottom left and bottom right.

<thinking>
In the left group, the shapes seem to be arranged in a more orderly, symmetrical manner. Circles, squares and triangles are often paired or balanced in their positioning.

In the right group, the arrangement of shapes appears more chaotic and asymmetrical. The shapes are scattered without a clear pattern or balance.

To determine the key difference, I'll count the total number of shapes in each image.

Left group shape counts: 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4
Right group shape counts: 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 5

The right group consistently has 4 or more shapes per image, while the left group has some images with only 3 shapes. This seems to be the clearest distinguishing factor between the two sets.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is the number of shapes in each image. The images in the left group contain either 3, 4, or 5 shapes, while the images in the right group all contain at least 4 shapes, with some having up to 6 shapes. The right group images are more complex with a greater number of elements compared to the left group.
