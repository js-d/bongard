Let me carefully examine each of the 12 images and provide a detailed description of them.

Left group:
1. The image shows a black triangular shape.
2. The image shows a black circular shape.
3. The image shows two black triangular shapes.
4. The image shows a black triangular shape and a black circular shape.
5. The image shows a black triangular shape and a black circular shape.
6. The image shows a black triangular shape and a black circular shape.

Right group:
1. The image shows a black triangular shape and a black circular shape.
2. The image shows two black triangular shapes and a black circular shape.
3. The image shows a black circular shape and two black triangular shapes.
4. The image shows three black triangular shapes and three black circular shapes.
5. The image shows a black triangular shape, a black circular shape, and a black inverted triangular shape.
6. The image shows a black triangular shape and a black circular shape.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group all contain either a single triangle or a single circle, while the images in the right group contain a combination of triangular and circular shapes, often more than one of each.
