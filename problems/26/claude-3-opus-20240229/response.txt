Left group:
1. A black jagged shape, a small black circle, two triangular shapes.
2. Three black circles of varying sizes, one triangular shape.
3. One small black circle, one triangular shape, three other black amorphous shapes.
4. Five black shapes of varying sizes - circles and triangles.
5. One downward-pointing triangular shape, one small black circle, two other black shapes - one circular and one irregular.
6. One triangular shape, three black circular shapes of varying sizes.

Right group:
1. One triangular shape, two circular shapes, one small dot.
2. One small black circle, two triangular shapes, three black circular shapes.
3. Two black circular shapes, a downward-pointing triangular shape, two upward-pointing triangular shapes.
4. Three black circular shapes, two triangular shapes pointing in opposite directions.
5. A downward-pointing triangular shape, three circular shapes of varying sizes, two triangular shapes.
6. Four circular shapes, two triangular shapes pointing in opposite directions.

<thinking>
The left group images seem to contain more irregular, jagged shapes compared to the right group. The right group has more regular shapes like circles and triangles.

The left group has a maximum of 3 triangular shapes per image, while the right group has images with more than 3 triangular shapes.

The right group appears to have triangular shapes oriented in opposite directions within the same images more often than the left group.

<answer>
The key differences between the left and right groups are:

The left group contains more irregular and jagged shapes, while the right group mostly consists of regular shapes like circles and triangles.

The right group has images with a higher number of triangular shapes (more than 3), whereas the left group has a maximum of 3 triangular shapes per image.

In the right group, triangular shapes pointing in opposite directions appear more frequently within the same images compared to the left group.
