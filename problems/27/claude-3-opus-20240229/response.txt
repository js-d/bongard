Left group:
1. A triangle shape at the top, a square in the middle, and 4 irregular shapes below in a roughly triangular arrangement.
2. A triangle at the top, a square in the middle, 2 irregular shapes on the left and right sides, and 2 irregular shapes below.
3. 2 triangles at the top, a square in the upper middle, and 5 irregular shapes arranged roughly in an inverted triangle below.
4. A triangle at the top, an irregular shape on the left, a square to the right of center, and 2 irregular shapes at the bottom.
5. 2 irregular shapes at the top, a triangle below and to the left, and a square to the right.
6. A square in the top left, an irregular shape to its right, a triangle in the middle, and 4 irregular shapes arranged roughly in a square at the bottom.

Right group:
1. A triangle at the top, an irregular shape on the left, 2 squares arranged vertically on the right.
2. An irregular shape at the top, a triangle below it, and 2 squares arranged horizontally at the bottom.
3. 2 irregular shapes at the top, a triangle on the left below them, and 3 squares arranged in a triangle on the right.
4. A square in the top left corner, an irregular shape to its right, a triangle in the middle, 2 irregular shapes below, and 2 squares in the bottom right.
5. A square in the top left, 2 irregular shapes to its right, a square in the middle, and 3 irregular shapes arranged in a triangle at the bottom.
6. 2 irregular shapes at the top, 2 squares arranged vertically on the left side, and 4 irregular shapes arranged in a square on the right side.

<thinking>
The key difference seems to be the presence of squares in the right group images. The left group images contain only one square each, while the right group images have multiple squares, usually 2 or more.

The squares in the right group are often arranged in distinctive patterns like vertical or horizontal lines, triangles, or as part of a larger shape like a square.

In contrast, the left group images have more varied and irregular arrangements of shapes, with only a single square included in each.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the right group contain multiple squares (usually 2 or more), often arranged in recognizable patterns like lines, triangles, or squares. The images in the left group each have only a single square, with the other shapes arranged more irregularly around it.
