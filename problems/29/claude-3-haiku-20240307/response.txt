Let me carefully analyze each of the 12 images in the left and right groups, and then determine the key difference between them.

Left group:
1. This image shows an irregular shape with a jagged outline and several small circular shapes or holes inside it.
2. This image shows a triangular shape with several small circular shapes or holes inside it.
3. This image shows a circular shape with a jagged, irregular outline and several small circular shapes or holes inside it.
4. This image shows a rectangular shape with several small circular shapes or holes inside it.
5. This image shows an irregularly shaped object with a jagged outline and multiple small circular shapes or holes inside it.
6. This image shows an irregularly shaped object with a jagged outline and several small circular shapes or holes inside it.

Right group:
1. This image shows a triangular shape with several small circular shapes or holes inside it, along with some small circular shapes or holes outside the main triangular shape.
2. This image shows a rectangular shape with several small circular shapes or holes inside it, along with some small circular shapes or holes outside the main rectangular shape.
3. This image shows a circular shape with a jagged, irregular outline and several small circular shapes or holes inside it, along with some small circular shapes or holes outside the main circular shape.
4. This image shows an irregularly shaped object with a jagged outline and multiple small circular shapes or holes inside it, along with some small circular shapes or holes outside the main object.
5. This image shows an irregularly shaped object with a jagged outline and several small circular shapes or holes inside it, along with some small circular shapes or holes outside the main object.
6. This image shows a triangular shape with several small circular shapes or holes inside it, along with some small circular shapes or holes outside the main triangular shape.

The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the images in the right group have additional small circular shapes or holes outside the main shapes, whereas the images in the left group only have the small circular shapes or holes inside the main shapes.
