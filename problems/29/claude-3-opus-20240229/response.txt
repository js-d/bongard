Left group:
1. A pixelated image showing a black blob shape with three circular holes inside it on a white background.
2. A pixelated triangular shape made of black pixels on a white background, with a single circular hole near the top vertex.
3. A pixelated circular shape made of black pixels on a white background, with a single circular hole inside it.
4. A pixelated rectangular shape made of black pixels on a white background, with four circular holes arranged in a 2x2 grid inside it.
5. A pixelated oval shape made of black pixels on a white background, with several circular holes of varying sizes scattered throughout it.
6. A pixelated rectangular shape made of black pixels on a white background, with six circular holes - three arranged vertically on the left side and three arranged in an L-shape on the right.

Right group:
1. A pixelated triangular shape made of black pixels on a white background, with five small circular holes - three inside the triangle and two outside near the base vertices.
2. A pixelated square shape made of black pixels on a white background, with five circular holes - four arranged in a square inside the shape and one outside on the upper left.
3. A pixelated circular shape made of black pixels on a white background, with seven small circular holes interspersed throughout the shape and around its perimeter.
4. A pixelated oval shape made of black pixels on a white background, with three circular holes - two inside and one outside on the left.
5. A pixelated image with three separate groupings of black pixels on a white background - a circular grouping with four small holes, a single pixel, and a triangular notch shape with two holes.
6. A pixelated triangular shape made of black pixels on a white background, with three circular holes - two inside the shape and one outside near the top vertex.

<thinking>
The key difference between the left and right groups seems to be the placement of the circular holes. In the left group, all the holes are contained within the black pixel shapes. In the right group, there are always some holes outside the main black pixel shapes.

To confirm, I'll check each image:
Left 1-6: Holes only inside shapes. ✓
Right 1: Has outside holes ✓
Right 2: Has an outside hole ✓
Right 3: Has outside holes ✓ 
Right 4: Has an outside hole ✓
Right 5: The single pixel and notch are basically "outside holes" ✓
Right 6: Has an outside hole ✓

The pattern is consistent, so this appears to be the key differentiating rule between the two groups.

<answer>
The difference between the images in the left group versus the right group is:
In the left group, all the circular holes are fully contained within the black pixelated shapes.
In the right group, there are always some circular holes positioned outside or on the edge of the main black pixelated shapes.
