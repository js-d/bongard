Let me carefully analyze each of the 12 images in the left and right groups, and then identify the key difference between them.

Left group:
1. The image shows a jagged, irregular outline with varying angles and curves. It appears to have a complex, asymmetrical shape.
2. This image shows a simple circular shape, with a uniform outline and a smooth, continuous curve.
3. The shape in this image is irregular and angular, with a pointed top and a curved bottom.
4. This image depicts a triangular shape, with a sharp point at the top and a flat base.
5. The shape in this image is a simple square, with four equal sides and 90-degree angles.
6. This image shows an irregular shape with a curved top and a pointed bottom, creating an asymmetrical appearance.

Right group:
1. The image shows a symmetrical, triangular shape with a smooth, continuous outline and a pointed top.
2. This image is completely blank, with no discernible shape or pattern.
3. The shape in this image is a simple square, with four equal sides and 90-degree angles.
4. This image depicts an irregular, asymmetrical shape with a curved outline and a pointed bottom.
5. The shape in this image is a simple, uniform rectangle, with two long sides and two short sides.
6. This image shows an asymmetrical shape with a curved top and a pointed bottom, creating a distinctive appearance.

The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group generally have more irregular, asymmetrical shapes, while the images in the right group tend to have more symmetrical, regular shapes. The left group contains shapes with varying angles, curves, and complexity, while the right group includes more simple, geometric shapes like triangles, squares, and rectangles.
