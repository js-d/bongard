<thinking>
The left group contains mostly open, linear, or angular shapes and outlines. The right group contains mostly closed, filled-in, solid shapes.

The left group shapes tend to point or open to the left or have detail on the right side. The right group shapes are more symmetrical or have detail balanced on both sides or in the center.

The left group gives an impression of sparseness, simplicity, and being unfinished or open-ended. The right group gives an impression of solidness, density, and being self-contained or complete.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the left group contains open, linear, angular shapes and outlines that tend to point left or have detail on the right side, while the right group contains closed, filled-in, solid shapes that are more symmetrical or balanced. The left group shapes appear sparse and unfinished, whereas the right group shapes seem dense, self-contained and complete.
