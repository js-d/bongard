Left group:
1. A black outline of an irregular curved shape resembling a simplified map of South America or Africa.
2. A black circle with a smaller white circle inside it, slightly off-center.
3. A black outline of an irregular angular shape with 5 points, resembling a simple drawing of a crown or zigzag.
4. Three black line segments forming an acute triangle pointing up and to the right.
5. A white square with a smaller black square inside it, positioned in the lower right corner.
6. A black line segment oriented vertically.

Right group:
1. A black equilateral triangle pointing downwards.
2. A black rectangle oriented vertically.
3. An X shape made of two intersecting diagonal black line segments.
4. Two small black circles side by side horizontally.
5. A black square positioned slightly off-center on a white background.
6. A black square outline with a smaller solid black square inside it, positioned in the upper right corner.

The left group contains more curved and irregular shapes, while the right group has more geometric and regular shapes like triangles, rectangles, and squares.

The left group images tend to have a primary shape with a secondary element inside or attached to it, while the right group shapes are more self-contained or have elements positioned side-by-side.

The left group has a mix of outline shapes and solid shapes, while the right group is predominantly solid black shapes on white backgrounds, with only one outline shape.

The differences seem to center around the regularity and types of shapes, the spatial relationships between multiple elements in an image, and the use of outlines vs. solid shapes.

<answer>
The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group each contain a single cohesive shape, while the images in the right group are composed of multiple distinct elements or shapes separated by whitespace. The left group shapes are singular and connected, even if they have additional interior elements, while the right group images feature multiple disconnected parts.
