Analyzing the 12 images provided, I can see that they are divided into two groups - a 'left' group and a 'right' group. Each group contains 6 images. Let me describe each image in detail:

Left group:
1. This image appears to be a simple black cross or 'X' shape, with the two lines intersecting at a central point.
2. This image shows a stylized letter 'S' shape, with the top and bottom endpoints curving inward.
3. This image depicts a curving shape that resembles the letter 'C', with the two ends meeting at a central point.
4. This image shows a spiraling or coiling shape, with the line forming an elongated 'S' or 'C' curve.
5. This image appears to be a simple, angular shape that resembles the letter 'V'.
6. This image shows a curving, looping shape that resembles the letter 'S' or a snake-like form.

Right group:
1. This image depicts a simple, triangular shape pointing upwards.
2. This image shows a curving shape that resembles the letter 'C' or a crescent moon.
3. This image appears to be a stylized letter 'Z' shape, with the two lines meeting at an angle.
4. This image depicts a heart-shaped form, with the two sides curling inwards to meet at a central point.
5. This image shows a simple, angular shape that resembles the letter 'L'.
6. This image appears to be a curving, snake-like form that resembles the letter 'S'.

The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group appears to be the overall shape and structure of the shapes. The images in the left group tend to have more curves, spirals, and interconnected forms, while the images in the right group are more angular and geometric, with fewer curves and more distinct, separate shapes.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the left group contains more curving, interconnected shapes, while the right group contains more angular, geometric shapes. The left group features shapes that resemble letters like 'S', 'C', and 'X', with curves and spirals, while the right group has more triangular, 'L'-shaped, and crescent-like forms.
