Left group:
1. A triangle pointing to the right, composed of connected line segments.
2. A shape resembling the number "6", composed of connected curved and straight line segments.
3. A curved line transitioning into a loop, resembling a cursive lowercase "e".
4. Two unconnected curved lines, resembling parentheses "()".
5. A shape resembling a cursive capital "D", composed of connected curved and straight line segments.
6. A shape resembling a cursive lowercase "a", composed of a loop connected to a curved line segment.

Right group:
1. A shape resembling a capital "A" without the horizontal bar, composed of two straight line segments meeting at an apex.
2. A curved line forming most of a loop but with an opening, resembling a cursive lowercase "c".
3. A zigzag shape composed of three connected straight line segments.
4. A shape resembling a heart formed from two curved lines meeting at a cusp.
5. A rectangular shape missing one of the longer sides, composed of three connected straight line segments.
6. A shape resembling a cursive capital "S", composed of connected curved line segments.

<thinking>
The left group contains shapes that are composed of curved and straight line segments that are all connected to each other within each shape. The shapes resemble lowercase and uppercase cursive letters, numbers, and common symbols.

The right group contains shapes that have disconnected or open parts, and are generally more angular. Some resemble uppercase print letters and other symbols. The line segments composing the shapes do not always connect to each other.

The key difference seems to be that the shapes in the left group have all of their line segments connected, forming complete, closed shapes. The shapes in the right group have disconnected parts or openings, forming incomplete, open shapes.
