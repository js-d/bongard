Let's analyze the 12 images in detail, starting with the 'left' group:

Left group:
1. This image shows a simple line drawing of a curve that loops back on itself, forming a semicircle or 'U' shape.
2. This image shows a similar curved line, but it has an additional loop or twist in the middle, creating a more complex shape.
3. This image shows a pair of curved lines that intersect, forming an 'X' or 'criss-cross' shape.
4. This image shows a single curved line that forms a closed loop, creating a circular or 'O' shape.
5. This image shows a pair of curved lines that intertwine, creating a more intricate, twisted shape.
6. This image shows a single curved line that forms a complete circular shape.

Right group:
1. This image shows a curved line with a loop at the end, creating a 'lasso' or 'hook' shape.
2. This image shows a pair of curved lines that intersect at multiple points, creating a more complex, tangled shape.
3. This image shows a pair of curved lines that form a 'figure-8' or 'infinity' shape.
4. This image shows two overlapping circular shapes, creating a 'Venn diagram' or 'interlocked' appearance.
5. This image shows a curved line with a loop at one end and a spiral or 'coil' shape at the other end.
6. This image shows a curved line with a loop at one end and a smaller circular shape at the other end, creating a 'lollipop' or 'flower' shape.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the left group images are generally simpler, with more basic shapes and fewer intersections or overlaps. The right group images are more complex, with more intricate shapes, intersections, and overlapping elements.

<answer>
The main difference between the left group and the right group is the complexity of the shapes and the number of intersections or overlaps. The left group images are generally simpler, with more basic shapes like semicircles, loops, and circular forms, while the right group images are more complex, with more intricate shapes, intersections, and overlapping elements like lasso or hook shapes, figure-8 forms, and interlocked circular shapes.
