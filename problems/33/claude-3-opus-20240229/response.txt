Left group:
1. A single diagonal line segment extending from top left to bottom right.
2. A five-pointed star shape made of connected line segments.
3. A square shape with a smaller square shape cut out from the top left corner.
4. A curved leaf-like shape made of a single curved line.
5. An infinity symbol shape made of two connected oval shapes.
6. An upward pointing equilateral triangle made of three connected line segments.

Right group:
1. A hexagon shape made of six connected line segments.
2. A circle shape made of a single curved line.
3. A square shape made of four connected line segments.
4. An irregular closed shape made of a single jagged curved line.
5. An apple-like shape made of a larger and smaller connected circle.
6. An irregular closed amoeba-like shape made of a single curved line.

<thinking>
The left group contains shapes that are made of straight lines, or a combination of straight and curved lines. The right group contains shapes that are made entirely of curved lines and are closed shapes.

The left group has more angular shapes with sharp corners, while the right group has rounded, curved shapes without sharp angles.

The left group shapes are open shapes that do not fully enclose an area, while the right group shapes are all closed shapes that fully enclose an inner area.

<answer>
The key difference between the left and right groups is that the left group contains open shapes made of straight lines or a combination of straight and curved lines, while the right group contains closed shapes made entirely of curved lines. The left group has more angular shapes with sharp corners, while the right group exclusively has smooth, rounded shapes.
