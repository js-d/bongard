Analyzing the images in the left group:

1. This image is a simple black square with a white circle in the center, creating a focused, simplified shape.
2. This image has a more complex, angular shape consisting of multiple black segments forming a curved, spiral-like structure.
3. This image shows a black circular shape with a small, triangular notch taken out of the top portion, creating an asymmetrical design.
4. This image depicts a black triangular shape with a small, rectangular opening in the center.
5. This image is a black, inverted triangular shape with a smaller, upright triangular shape nested inside it.
6. This image displays a black, oval-like shape with a small, hexagonal opening in the center.

Analyzing the images in the right group:

1. This image shows a black circular shape with a small, triangular protrusion on the top portion, creating an asymmetrical design.
2. This image depicts a black, triangular shape with a small, rectangular opening in the center.
3. This image displays a black, irregular shape with a small, rectangular opening in the center.
4. This image has a black, asymmetrical shape with a small, square opening in the center.
5. This image shows a black, jagged, mountain-like shape with a small, triangular opening in the center.
6. This image depicts a black, triangular shape with a small, rectangular opening in the center.

Differences between the left and right groups:

The images in the left group seem to have more symmetrical, geometric shapes, with a focus on circular and triangular forms. The images in the right group, on the other hand, appear to have more irregular, asymmetrical shapes with various types of openings or cutouts.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is the level of symmetry and regularity in the shapes. The images in the left group tend to have more symmetrical, geometric shapes, such as circles, triangles, and spirals, while the images in the right group have more irregular, asymmetrical shapes with various types of openings or cutouts. The left group appears to emphasize simple, focused shapes, while the right group features more complex, dynamic shapes.
