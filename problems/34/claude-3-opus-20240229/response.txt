The left group images all have the white shape cut out from the interior of the black shape, fully enclosed by the black portion. The white parts do not touch or intersect the outer border of the black shapes.

In contrast, the right group images have the white shape cut out from the border or edge of the black shape, with the white part intersecting the perimeter. The white cutouts touch the outside in each of the right group images.

The key difference between the left and right groups is the placement of the white cutout shapes. In the left group, the white shapes are cut out from the interior of the black shapes, fully contained within the black borders. In the right group, the white shapes intersect and touch the outer edges of the black shapes.
