The key difference between the left and right groups seems to be the location and shape of the white cutout or hole within the black shapes. In the left group, the cutouts are consistently small rectangles, usually located along an edge or corner of the black shape. In the right group, the cutouts vary more in shape (rectangle, oval, diamond) and tend to be positioned more towards the center of the black shapes, often not touching an edge.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and right group is the placement and shape of the white cutouts within the black shapes. The left group features small rectangular cutouts consistently placed along an edge or corner of the black shapes. In contrast, the right group has cutouts of varying shapes (rectangular, oval, diamond) that are positioned more centrally within the black forms, often not touching an edge.
