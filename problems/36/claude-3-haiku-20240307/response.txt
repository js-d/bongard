Analyzing the left group images:

1. The image shows a black upright triangle.
2. The image shows a black circle.
3. The image shows a black downward-pointing triangle.
4. The image shows a black circle and a black upward-pointing triangle.
5. The image shows a black upward-pointing triangle and a black circle.
6. The image shows a black upward-pointing triangle and a black circle.

Analyzing the right group images:

1. The image shows a black circle.
2. The image shows a black upward-pointing triangle.
3. The image shows a black circle and a black upward-pointing triangle.
4. The image shows a black circle and a black downward-pointing triangle.
5. The image shows a black circle and a black upward-pointing triangle.
6. The image shows a black circle and a black downward-pointing triangle.

The key difference between the left group and the right group appears to be the spatial arrangement of the shapes. In the left group, the shapes are arranged in a more organized, symmetrical manner, with the triangle and circle either aligned vertically or horizontally. In contrast, the shapes in the right group are more randomly arranged, with the triangle and circle sometimes appearing together but in different spatial configurations.

<answer>
The key difference between the left group and the right group of images is the spatial arrangement of the shapes.

Left group:
1. Upright triangle
2. Circle
3. Downward-pointing triangle
4. Circle and upward-pointing triangle
5. Upward-pointing triangle and circle
6. Upward-pointing triangle and circle

The shapes in the left group are arranged in a more organized, symmetrical manner, with the triangle and circle either aligned vertically or horizontally.

Right group:
1. Circle
2. Upward-pointing triangle
3. Circle and upward-pointing triangle
4. Circle and downward-pointing triangle
5. Circle and upward-pointing triangle
6. Circle and downward-pointing triangle

The shapes in the right group are more randomly arranged, with the triangle and circle sometimes appearing together but in different spatial configurations.
