To analyze the images in the left and right groups, I will describe each image in detail, focusing on the shapes, positions, and relationships between the geometric elements.

Left group:
1. The image contains a black triangle, a black square, and a black circle.
2. The image contains a black triangle, a black square, and a black circle, arranged differently than in the first image.
3. The image contains a black triangle and two black circles.
4. The image contains a black triangle, a black square, and a black circle, arranged differently than in the previous images.
5. The image contains a black triangle, a black square, and a black circle, arranged differently than in the previous images.
6. The image contains a black triangle, a black square, and a black circle, arranged differently than in the previous images.

Right group:
1. The image contains a black triangle and a black circle.
2. The image contains a black circle and a black square.
3. The image contains a black circle, a black triangle, and a black square.
4. The image contains a black circle, a black square, and a black triangle.
5. The image contains a black circle, a black square, and a black triangle.
6. The image contains a black circle, a black square, and a black triangle.

The main difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group contain the same three geometric shapes (triangle, square, and circle) arranged in different configurations, while the images in the right group contain the same three geometric shapes but in different arrangements and combinations.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group all contain the same three geometric shapes (a triangle, a square, and a circle) arranged in various configurations, while the images in the right group contain the same three shapes but in different combinations and positions.

In the left group, the three shapes are always present, but their relative positions and arrangements vary between the images. For example, in the first image, the triangle is at the top, the square is in the middle, and the circle is at the bottom, while in the fourth image, the triangle is at the top, the circle is in the middle, and the square is at the bottom.

In contrast, the right group images feature the same three shapes, but they are not always all present in each image. Some images, like the first one, have only a triangle and a circle, while others, like the third and fourth, have all three shapes but in different arrangements.

So, the key distinction is that the left group demonstrates variations on a consistent configuration of the three shapes, while the right group shows different combinations and placements of the same shapes.
