To analyze the 12 images, I will first describe each image in the 'left' group and then the 'right' group. After that, I will explain the key difference between the two groups.

Left group:
1. This image shows a simple black triangle and a black circle.
2. This image shows a black triangle and a black circle arranged differently compared to the previous image.
3. This image shows a larger black triangle and a smaller black circle.
4. This image shows a black triangle with a curved bottom edge and a black circle.
5. This image shows a black triangle with a shorter base and a black circle.
6. This image shows a black triangle with a longer base and a black circle.

Right group:
1. This image shows a black circle and a smaller black triangle.
2. This image shows a black circle and a black triangle arranged differently compared to the previous image.
3. This image shows a larger black circle and a smaller black triangle.
4. This image shows a black circle with a curved edge and a black triangle.
5. This image shows a black circle with a smaller diameter and a black triangle.
6. This image shows a black circle with a larger diameter and a black triangle.

The key difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group is the relative size and arrangement of the triangle and circle shapes. In the 'left' group, the triangle is generally larger than the circle, and the two shapes are arranged in a more consistent pattern. In the 'right' group, the circle is generally larger than the triangle, and the arrangement of the two shapes is more varied.

The key difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group is that in the 'left' group, the triangle shape is generally larger than the circle shape, and the two shapes are arranged in a more consistent pattern. In the 'right' group, the circle shape is generally larger than the triangle shape, and the arrangement of the two shapes is more varied.
