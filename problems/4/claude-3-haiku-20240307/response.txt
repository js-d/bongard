Let's analyze the 12 images carefully, starting with the 'left group':

Left group:
1. The image shows a simple black circle.
2. The image shows a black triangular shape pointing upwards.
3. The image shows a black oval shape.
4. The image shows a black leaf-like shape.
5. The image shows a black triangular shape pointing downwards.
6. The image shows an irregular black shape that appears to be a partially closed polygon.

Right group:
1. The image shows a black 'S'-shaped curve.
2. This image is completely blank, with no discernible shapes or patterns.
3. The image shows three triangular peaks, with the middle peak being the tallest.
4. The image shows a black shape that resembles a boomerang or a curved 'L'.
5. The image shows a black 'V'-shaped pattern.
6. The image shows a black shape that resembles a backward 'C' or a snake-like curve.

To identify the difference between the two groups, I notice that the shapes in the 'left group' are more basic and geometric, such as circles, triangles, and ovals, while the shapes in the 'right group' are more complex and irregular, with curves, peaks, and more abstract patterns.

<answer>
The key difference between the 'left group' and the 'right group' of images appears to be the complexity and irregularity of the shapes. The 'left group' consists of simple, geometric shapes like circles, triangles, and ovals, while the 'right group' contains more complex, irregular shapes with curves, peaks, and abstract patterns. The 'left group' images appear to be more basic and straightforward, while the 'right group' images are more intricate and complex.
