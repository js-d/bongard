Left group:
1. A black circle with a small gap or opening at the bottom.
2. A black right triangle pointing to the right.
3. A black oval shape.
4. A black curved shape resembling a kidney bean or cashew, oriented vertically with the concave side facing left.
5. A black equilateral triangle pointing downwards.
6. A black shape resembling a house or pentagon, with a peaked top and flat bottom.

Right group:
1. A black curved shape resembling a kidney bean or cashew, oriented horizontally with the concave side facing downwards.
2. Two black kidney bean shapes connected end-to-end, forming an S-like curve.
3. Three black teardrop shapes arranged in a triangular formation, with the points facing inward.
4. A black shape resembling the letter M or the top of a crown.
5. A black angular shape resembling a less-than sign "<" or a zigzag.
6. A black curved shape resembling a backwards letter C or a circular segment with a gap on the right side.

<thinking>
The left group contains mostly simple, singular shapes. Some are closed shapes like a circle, oval, and triangle, while others have openings or gaps like the kidney bean and house shapes. The orientation varies but they all seem to be individual, standalone shapes.

The right group contains more complex shapes, many of which seem to be composed of multiple parts or have a more intricate structure. Several resemble letters, symbols or icons like an S, M, less-than sign, and backwards C. The shapes appear more open and interconnected compared to the singular closed shapes in the left group.

The key difference appears to be that the left group consists of singular, mostly closed shapes, while the right group contains composite shapes that are more open, interconnected, and iconic.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group depict singular, simple shapes that are mostly closed, while the images in the right group show more complex, composite shapes that often resemble symbols, letters, or icons and have a more open and interconnected structure.
