Left group:
1. A black outline of a circular shape on a white background.
2. A black outline of an equilateral triangle on a white background.
3. A solid black irregular oval shape on a white background.
4. A black outline of a hexagon on a white background.
5. A solid black downward-pointing equilateral triangle on a white background.
6. A black outline of a 5-sided irregular polygon on a white background.

Right group:
1. A black outline of a kidney bean shape on a white background.
2. A black outline of two curved lines intersecting to form an "S"-like shape on a white background.
3. A black outline of a shape resembling a capital "M" on a white background.
4. A black outline of an irregular shape resembling a backwards "L" on a white background.
5. A black outline of an irregular "E"-like shape on a white background, where the upper and lower horizontal lines do not connect to the vertical line.
6. A black outline of a comma-like shape on a white background.

The left group contains shapes that are all closed, meaning the outlines connect to enclose a space. These include basic geometric shapes like circles, triangles, and hexagons, as well as some irregular polygons.

In contrast, the right group contains shapes that are all open, meaning the outlines do not connect to enclose a space. These shapes resemble letters, punctuation marks, or more organic, curved forms.

The key difference seems to be that the left group shapes are closed, while the right group shapes are open.

<answer>
The images in the left group are all closed shapes, meaning their outlines connect to fully enclose a space. The images in the right group are all open shapes, meaning their outlines do not connect to enclose a space.
