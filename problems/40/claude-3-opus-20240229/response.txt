Left group:
1. Four irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged roughly in a square pattern but not perfectly aligned.
2. Four irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in a slightly skewed diamond pattern.
3. Four irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in a triangular pattern with one shape at the top and three below.
4. Four irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in a skewed square pattern.
5. Three irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in a triangular pattern with two shapes at the top and one below.
6. Five irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in an X pattern with one shape in the center.

Right group:
1. Four irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in a square pattern with two shapes at the top and two at the bottom, aligned vertically and horizontally.
2. Five irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in a cross pattern with one shape in the center and four surrounding it.
3. Five irregular black shapes on a white background, scattered in a seemingly random pattern with one shape isolated at the top.
4. Four irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in a diamond pattern.
5. Five irregular black shapes on a white background, arranged in a pentagon pattern.
6. Five irregular black shapes on a white background, scattered in a seemingly random pattern with one shape isolated at the bottom.

The key differences I notice between the left and right groups are:

1. The shapes in the left group tend to be arranged in more structured, geometric patterns like squares, diamonds, and triangles. The right group has some geometric arrangements but also more scattered, random-looking configurations.

2. The left group images contain either 3, 4, or 5 shapes. The right group consistently has 4 or 5 shapes in each image.

3. In the left group, when there is an odd number of shapes, they tend to form triangular arrangements. In the right group, an odd number of shapes usually has one isolated shape separated from the others.

So in summary, the left group favors more structured, geometric arrangements, while the right allows more asymmetry and randomness. The left also allows 3 shapes while the right has a minimum of 4.

<answer>
The images in the left group contain 3-5 irregular black shapes arranged in structured, geometric patterns like squares, diamonds, and triangles. An odd number of shapes forms a triangular arrangement.

The right group images consistently contain 4-5 shapes. While some are in geometric patterns, others are more scattered and random-looking. An odd number of shapes usually results in one shape being isolated from the rest.

In summary, the left group prefers structured geometric arrangements and allows 3 shapes, while the right group permits more asymmetry and randomness with a minimum of 4 shapes.
