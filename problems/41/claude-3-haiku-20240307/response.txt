To describe the images in the left and right groups, I will focus on the shapes, patterns, and arrangements of the black pixels in each image.

Left group:
1. The image contains several irregularly shaped black blobs scattered across the frame, with varying sizes and positions.
2. The image has a similar arrangement of black blobs, but they are more evenly distributed across the frame.
3. This image has a single, large black blob in the center of the frame.
4. The black blobs in this image are more circular in shape and are more densely packed together.
5. This image has a more random arrangement of black blobs, with some larger and some smaller.
6. The black blobs in this image are more varied in size and shape, with some elongated or curved shapes.

Right group:
1. The image contains a mix of circular and irregularly shaped black blobs, with some overlapping or touching each other.
2. This image has a more symmetrical arrangement of black blobs, with a larger blob in the center surrounded by smaller blobs.
3. The black blobs in this image are more uniform in size and shape, with a more ordered arrangement.
4. The black blobs in this image are more evenly distributed, with some larger and some smaller blobs.
5. This image has a mix of circular and angular black blobs, with some overlapping or touching each other.
6. The black blobs in this image are more varied in size and shape, with some elongated or curved shapes.

The key difference between the left and right groups is the level of order and symmetry in the arrangement of the black blobs. The images in the left group have a more random and scattered arrangement, while the images in the right group have a more ordered and symmetrical arrangement of the black blobs.
