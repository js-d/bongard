Left group:
1. Six black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged roughly in a triangular formation with one shape at the top, two in the middle row, and three in the bottom row.
2. Five black irregular shapes on a white background, positioned with two shapes in the top row, one in the middle, and two in the bottom row.
3. Six black irregular shapes on a white background, with one shape at the top, two in the second row, and three in the bottom row, forming a triangular arrangement.
4. Six black irregular shapes on a white background, with one shape at the top, two in the second row, one in the third row, and two in the bottom row, creating a diamond-like formation.
5. Six black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a roughly triangular pattern with two shapes at the top, one in the middle row, and three in the bottom row.
6. Seven black irregular shapes on a white background, positioned with one shape at the top, two in the second row, one in the third row, two in the fourth row, and one at the bottom, forming a symmetrical arrangement.

Right group:
1. Six black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a circular or hexagonal formation with each shape connected to at least two others.
2. Six black irregular shapes on a white background, positioned in a roughly circular arrangement with each shape connected to at least two others, forming a closed loop.
3. Seven black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a circular formation with each shape connected to at least two others, creating a closed loop with one shape in the center.
4. Seven black irregular shapes on a white background, positioned in a circular arrangement with each shape connected to at least two others, forming a closed loop with one shape in the center.
5. Eight black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a circular formation with each shape connected to at least two others, creating a closed loop with two shapes in the center.
6. Eight black irregular shapes on a white background, positioned in a circular arrangement with each shape connected to at least two others, forming a closed loop with two shapes in the center.

<thinking>
- The left group images have shapes arranged in roughly triangular, diamond, or symmetrical formations, while the right group images have shapes arranged in circular or closed-loop formations.
- In the left group, the shapes are not connected to each other, while in the right group, each shape is connected to at least two others.
- The number of shapes in the left group ranges from 5 to 7, while the right group consistently has 6 to 8 shapes.
- The right group images appear to have a more structured and interconnected arrangement compared to the more scattered formations in the left group.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is the arrangement and connectivity of the shapes. In the left group, the black irregular shapes are arranged in various formations such as triangular, diamond, or symmetrical patterns, but they are not connected to each other. The number of shapes in the left group images ranges from 5 to 7.

In contrast, the images in the right group feature the black irregular shapes arranged in circular or closed-loop formations, with each shape connected to at least two others. This creates a more structured and interconnected appearance. The right group images consistently have between 6 and 8 shapes.
