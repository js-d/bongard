Left group:
1. A squiggly line that starts high on the left, dips down, then rises up to the right.
2. A longer squiggly line with multiple oscillations, starting high on the left and ending lower on the right.
3. A short squiggly line segment on the left, followed by a gap, then another short squiggly segment on the right that ends lower than the first.
4. A longer continuous squiggly line with many oscillations, trending downward from left to right.
5. A series of peaks and valleys increasing in frequency from left to right, resembling a simple waveform.
6. A symmetrical waveform starting in the center, widening out, then converging back to the center.

Right group:
1. A waveform starting low on the left, oscillating up with increasing amplitude.
2. A series of oscillating line segments of equal length with small gaps between them.
3. A waveform starting high on the left and oscillating downward with decreasing amplitude.
4. A long sequence of oscillating curves representing a full word or phrase.
5. A waveform starting low on the left and oscillating upwards with increasing frequency.
6. A waveform oscillating around a central horizontal axis with approximately equal amplitude above and below the axis.

The key differences I notice between the left and right groups are:
- The left group images are generally continuous lines or curves, while the right group has more distinct separated segments
- The right group images tend to start on the left side and end higher on the right side, showing an upward trend, while the left group is more balanced or trends downward
- The right group shows more variation in amplitude and frequency from left to right within each image compared to the left group
- The right group has a few longer images that likely represent full words or phrases, while the left seems to be shorter, simpler waveforms

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group versus the right group is that the right group images exhibit an upward trend, starting lower on the left side and ending higher on the right, with increasing amplitude and/or frequency. The images on the right also contain more distinct separated segments compared to the generally continuous curves in the left group. Additionally, a few of the right images are longer, likely representing full words, while the left images are shorter and resemble simpler waveforms or curves.
