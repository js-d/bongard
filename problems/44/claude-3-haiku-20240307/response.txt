To analyze the differences between the two groups of images, I will examine each image in detail and look for patterns or distinguishing features.

Left group:
1. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape at the end.
2. This image shows a curved line with two small circular shapes at the ends.
3. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the middle.
4. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the top and another near the bottom.
5. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the top and another near the bottom, with a small gap between them.
6. This image shows a curved line with two small circular shapes, one near the top and one near the bottom, connected by a short, straight line segment.

Right group:
1. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the end.
2. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the middle.
3. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the end, and a small gap between the circular shape and the rest of the line.
4. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the top and another near the bottom, connected by a straight line segment.
5. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the top and another near the bottom, with a gap between them.
6. This image shows a curved line with a small circular shape near the top and another near the bottom, connected by a short, straight line segment.

The key difference between the left and right groups is the placement of the small circular shapes along the curved lines. In the left group, the circular shapes are all positioned along the curving lines, while in the right group, the circular shapes are often separated from the main curved line by a small gap or connected to the line by a short, straight segment.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group is the placement of the small circular shapes along the curved lines. In the left group, the circular shapes are all positioned directly along the curving lines, while in the right group, the circular shapes are often separated from the main curved line by a small gap or connected to the line by a short, straight segment.
