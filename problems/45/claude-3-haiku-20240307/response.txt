Analyzing the images in the left group:

1. This image shows a circular shape with a smaller circular shape inside it, creating a ring-like structure.
2. This image shows a triangular shape.
3. This image shows a rectangular shape with a triangular shape nested inside it.
4. This image shows a triangular shape with a smaller triangular shape nested inside it.
5. This image shows a shape that resembles a square with a smaller square nested inside it.
6. This image shows a triangular shape with a circular shape nested inside it.

Analyzing the images in the right group:

1. This image shows a triangular shape with a smaller triangular shape nested inside it, but the smaller triangle is positioned differently compared to the left group.
2. This image shows two circular shapes, one larger and one smaller.
3. This image shows a rectangular shape with a diamond-like shape nested inside it.
4. This image shows a circular shape with a square shape nested inside it.
5. This image shows a circular shape with a smaller triangular shape nested inside it.
6. This image shows a triangular shape with a smaller triangular shape nested inside it, but the smaller triangle is positioned differently compared to the left group.

Comparing the left and right groups:
The key difference between the left and right groups is the orientation and positioning of the nested shapes within the larger shapes. In the left group, the nested shapes are more centrally located and symmetrically positioned within the larger shapes. In the right group, the nested shapes are more asymmetrically positioned within the larger shapes.

<answer>
The difference between the left group and the right group is the positioning and orientation of the nested shapes within the larger shapes. In the left group, the nested shapes are more centrally located and symmetrically positioned within the larger shapes, while in the right group, the nested shapes are more asymmetrically positioned within the larger shapes.
