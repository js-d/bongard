Left group:
1. Two overlapping solid black shapes forming a black and white abstract image. The larger shape is a circle with a segment missing, the smaller is a full circle overlapping the larger shape.
2. A solid black right-pointing arrow shape, with the arrowhead formed by a triangular cutout of the rectangular shaft.
3. A solid black rectangle with a triangular notch cut out of the top edge, resembling an open-top box shape or a rectangular hole punched out of a larger black rectangle.
4. A solid black irregular shape resembling a right-pointing arrow, but with the arrowhead formed by an additional triangular protrusion rather than a cutout. The overall shape is made of two overlapping triangles.
5. A solid black square with a smaller square notch cut out of the bottom right corner.
6. Two overlapping solid black circular shapes, forming an abstract rounded hourglass-like shape against the white background.

Right group:
1. A solid black triangular arrowhead shape pointing right, formed by two triangles with their points touching.
2. Two overlapping solid black elliptical shapes, with the right shape only a partial ellipse, resulting in an abstract black and white image with curves and a sharp corner.
3. A black rectangle serving as a frame around an empty white square in the center, resembling a picture frame or window.
4. A solid black square or rectangle overlapping a white circular shape, with the circle cutting a curved notch out of the bottom edge of the black shape.
5. A circular shape with a triangular wedge cut out, resembling the Pac-Man video game character facing left.
6. A solid black triangle with its point touching a smaller solid black circle, together resembling a geometric tadpole shape facing left.

<thinking>
The left group images all appear to show shapes that are made by cutting out or removing parts from a larger solid shape. The remaining black shapes have missing pieces or negative space carved out of them.

In contrast, the right group images seem to be composed of multiple distinct solid shapes that overlap or touch each other, without cutouts. The black shapes are whole and uncut, but combined to make more complex shapes.

So the key difference appears to be that the left images contain single shapes with parts missing, while the right images combine multiple complete shapes together.

<answer>
The images in the left group all show single black shapes that have pieces or segments cut out of them, leaving behind negative space. The remaining shapes have missing parts.

The images in the right group are all composed of multiple separate black shapes that overlap or touch each other, without anything cut out from the individual shapes. The shapes are combined, but each shape remains whole and complete.
