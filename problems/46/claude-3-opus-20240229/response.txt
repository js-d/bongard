Left group:
1. A black silhouette of a triangle with a small triangular cutout at the top.
2. Two incomplete black circular shapes, like a half circle on the left and a quarter circle on the right, together forming a stylized pacman-like shape.
3. A black circle with a small triangular cutout at the top.
4. A black circular shape with a smaller white circular cutout inside it, near the top.
5. A black equilateral triangle with a white circular cutout in the center.
6. An incomplete black circular shape, like a pacman symbol.

Right group:
1. A black circular shape with a small triangular protrusion pointing to the right.
2. Three small black triangular shapes arranged in a larger triangular formation, with the top triangle inverted.
3. A black right-angled triangular shape with a small circular cutout in the top corner.
4. Two black circular shapes of different sizes overlapping to form a stylized Venn diagram.
5. A black circular shape with a smaller circular cutout, giving the appearance of a circular arch or hook shape.
6. A black keyhole-like shape, with a circular part on the left and a triangular part extending to the right.

<thinking>
The left group images all contain shapes with cutouts or missing parts within a single larger shape. The cutouts are located inside the main shape.

In contrast, the right group images feature shapes with added elements or protrusions extending outward from the main shape. The additional parts are external to the primary shape.

The key difference seems to be that the left group has internal cutouts or missing parts, while the right group has external additions or protrusions.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is:

The left group contains shapes with internal cutouts or missing parts within a single larger shape. The cutouts or missing sections are located inside the main shape.

The right group features shapes with external additions, protrusions, or overlapping elements that extend outward from the primary shape. These additional parts are located outside the main shape.
