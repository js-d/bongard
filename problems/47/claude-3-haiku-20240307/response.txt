To analyze the images and find the difference between the left and right groups, I will describe each image in detail:

Left group:
1. The image shows a black triangle inside a black circle.
2. The image shows a black triangle and a smaller black triangle inside a black circle.
3. The image shows multiple black triangles of various sizes and orientations within a black circle.
4. The image shows a black triangle, a smaller black triangle, and a black circle within a larger black circle.
5. The image shows multiple black circles and triangles within a larger black circle.
6. The image shows a large black triangle and a smaller black triangle within a black circle.

Right group:
1. The image shows a black triangle with a smaller black circle inside it.
2. The image shows a black circle and a black triangle.
3. The image shows a black triangle, a black circle, and smaller black circles.
4. The image shows various black triangles and circles arranged in a pattern.
5. The image shows several black triangles and circles of different sizes.
6. The image shows a large black triangle with a smaller black circle inside it, along with other smaller black triangles and circles.

The key difference between the left and right groups seems to be the presence and arrangement of the shapes within the circles. The left group images all have a circle as the main element, with various triangles and other shapes inside the circle. In contrast, the right group images have a more varied arrangement of the shapes, with the circle not always being the primary element.

<answer>
The key difference between the left group and the right group is the arrangement and composition of the shapes within the images.

The left group images all have a black circle as the main element, with various black triangles and other shapes arranged inside the circle. The shapes within the circle are the primary focus of these images.

In contrast, the right group images have a more varied arrangement of the shapes, with the circle not always being the primary element. The shapes, including triangles and circles, are arranged in different patterns and compositions, without a consistent central circle.

Overall, the left group images appear to have a more structured and centralized composition, with the shapes arranged within a circular frame, while the right group images have a more dynamic and varied arrangement of the geometric shapes.
