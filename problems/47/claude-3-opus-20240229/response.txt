Left group:
1. A black outlined circle with a small black triangle inside at the top.
2. A black outlined circle with a small black triangle inside at the top, and a smaller black outlined circle to the left of the large circle.
3. Four black outlined triangles of varying sizes arranged in a roughly circular formation.
4. A black outlined circle with a black triangle inside at the top, and a small black outlined circle to the bottom left outside the main circle.
5. Four black outlined circles of equal size arranged in a circular formation with a black outlined triangle in the center pointing upwards.
6. A black outlined equilateral triangle with a black outlined circle inside at the top center, and a smaller black outlined circle outside the triangle at the bottom right corner.

Right group:
1. A black outlined equilateral triangle with a small black outlined circle in the center.
2. A large black outlined circle with a smaller black outlined circle inside and tangent to the top of the larger circle.
3. Four black outlined circles, three small and equal in size arranged in a triangular formation, with a larger circle in the center of the three.
4. A black outlined equilateral triangle with a black outlined circle at the top vertex, and a smaller black outlined triangle inside and tangent to the base of the larger triangle.
5. A black outlined equilateral triangle with a small black outlined circle at the top vertex, and two smaller black outlined triangles of equal size arranged vertically and inside the main triangle.
6. Six black outlined circles, five small and equal in size arranged in a triangular formation pointing upwards, with a larger circle in the center of the five.

<thinking>
The left group seems to feature circles prominently, with triangles inside or around them in various arrangements. The right group appears to prioritize triangles, with circles placed at vertices or arranged inside the triangles.

In the left group, when multiple shapes are present, the circles are the dominant shape in terms of size and position. Triangles are secondary or supporting elements. In the right group, the opposite is true - triangles are the primary shape, with circles acting as accents or secondary shapes.

The left group has more instances of shapes placed outside the main shape, while in the right group, most secondary shapes are contained within the primary triangle shape.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is the dominant shape and the relationship between the shapes. In the left group, circles are the primary shape, with triangles acting as secondary or supporting elements. Shapes in the left group are more often arranged with the secondary shape outside the primary circle.

In the right group, triangles are the dominant shape, with circles serving as accents or secondary elements. The right group favors arrangements where the secondary shapes are contained within the main triangular shape.
