To analyze the images, I will describe each of the 12 images in detail, focusing on their shapes, sizes, and arrangements.

Left group:
1. The image contains a large black triangle shape and a smaller black circular shape.
2. This image contains a large black circular shape and a small black square shape.
3. The image has a small black square shape and a larger black triangle shape.
4. This image has a variety of shapes, including a large black circular shape, a smaller black square shape, and a triangular shape.
5. The image contains a large black circular shape, a smaller black triangular shape, and a square shape.
6. This image has a large black circular shape, a smaller black triangular shape, and a square shape.

Right group:
1. The image contains a single black triangular shape.
2. This image has a black triangular shape and two smaller black circular shapes.
3. The image contains a variety of shapes, including a black triangular shape, two smaller black circular shapes, and a rectangular shape.
4. This image has a large black circular shape, a smaller black triangular shape, and two smaller black circular shapes.
5. The image contains a large black circular shape, two smaller black triangular shapes, and a small square shape.
6. This image has a large black circular shape, a smaller black triangular shape, and a rectangular shape.

The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group contain a greater variety of shapes and arrangements, while the images in the right group have a more consistent pattern of shapes, with the triangular shape being a common element in all of the images.
