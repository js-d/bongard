Left group:
1. A triangle shape and a circular shape
2. Four shapes arranged in a square pattern - two square shapes, a triangular shape, and a circular shape
3. Six shapes arranged with a circular shape at the top, a triangular shape below it, two square shapes side-by-side below that, and a circular shape and triangular shape at the bottom
4. Five shapes arranged with two circular shapes at the top, a square shape in the middle, and two triangular shapes at the bottom forming an upside-down "V"
5. Six shapes with a circular shape and square shape at the top, a circular shape in the middle, and a triangular shape surrounded by two square shapes at the bottom
6. A circular shape at the top, followed by a circular shape, square shape, and two triangular shapes arranged in a diamond at the bottom

Right group:
1. A triangular shape at the top, a square shape in the middle, and three circular shapes at the bottom
2. A circular shape at the top, a triangular shape and square shape side-by-side in the middle, and three circular shapes at the bottom
3. A circular shape at the top, a square shape to the left and circular shape to the right in the middle, and triangular shapes at the bottom corners with a square shape between them
4. A square shape and two circular shapes forming a triangular arrangement at the top, with a triangular shape at the bottom point, and square shapes in the bottom corners
5. Two circular shapes at the top, a square shape between them, two triangular shapes below the square forming a diamond shape, and a circular shape at the bottom
6. A triangular shape at the top, a square shape to the left and circular shape to the right below it, and two circular shapes at the bottom with a square shape between them

<thinking>
The key difference between the left and right groups seems to be the number of circles/circular shapes present. In the left group, each image contains no more than 2 circles. However, in the right group, each image contains at least 3 circles, often more.

The left group favors triangular and square shapes, with circles being less prevalent. The right group has a greater emphasis on circular shapes, with each image containing 3 or more circles arranged in various patterns with the triangles and squares.

So in summary:
Left group: 2 or fewer circles per image
Right group: 3 or more circles per image
</thinking>

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group versus the right group is the number of circles present. The images in the left group each contain a maximum of 2 circular shapes, while the images in the right group all contain at least 3 circular shapes, often more. The left group images favor triangular and square shapes with fewer circles, while the right group emphasizes circular shapes in each arrangement.
