Analyzing the images in the left group:

1. The image shows a circular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it.
2. The image shows a rectangular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it.
3. The image shows a triangular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it.
4. The image shows a circular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it, similar to the first image.
5. The image shows an oval shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it.
6. The image shows a circular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it, similar to the first and fourth images.

Analyzing the images in the right group:

1. The image shows an asymmetrical, irregularly shaped object with several smaller circular shapes inside it.
2. The image shows an oval shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it, similar to the fifth image in the left group.
3. The image shows a triangular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it, similar to the third image in the left group.
4. The image shows a triangular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it, similar to the third and previous images in the right group.
5. The image shows a rectangular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it, similar to the second image in the left group.
6. The image shows a triangular shape with several smaller circular shapes inside it, similar to the third and previous images in the right group.

The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is the overall shape of the main object. The images in the left group all have a regular, symmetrical shape (circle, rectangle, triangle), while the images in the right group have more irregular, asymmetrical shapes.
