Left group:
1. A filled circle with 3 small squares surrounding it, forming a roughly triangular shape. The squares are located at approximately 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions relative to the circle.
2. A hollow square with 4 small squares surrounding it. One square is inside the hollow square, the others are outside at roughly 12 o'clock, 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions.
3. A hollow triangle pointing upwards, with 4 small squares surrounding it. The squares are at approximately 12 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock positions relative to the triangle.
4. A hollow circle with 3 small squares around it forming a triangular shape. The squares are at 12 o'clock, 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions.
5. An oval or ellipse shape made of pixels, with two small squares to the left and right sides of it.
6. A filled circle with 5 small squares surrounding it. The squares are distributed around the circle at 1 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 8 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions.

Right group:
1. An oval or ellipse shape made of pixels, with 3 small squares near it - two touching its left side, one touching its right.
2. A hollow circle with 5 small squares around it. The squares are at 12 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock, 7 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions relative to the circle.
3. A filled circle with several small squares scattered around it, not touching the circle. There are 2 squares above, 2 below, and 1 each to the left and right of the circle.
4. A hollow diamond shape made of pixels, with 5 small squares near its edges. 2 squares are above the diamond, 2 below, and 1 to its right side.
5. A hollow triangle shape pointing upwards, made of pixels. 5 small squares surround it - 2 on the left side, 2 on the right, and 1 below the triangle.
6. A hollow rectangle standing vertically, with 4 small squares near it. 2 squares are to the left of the rectangle, 2 are to its right.

The key differences between the left and right groups seem to be:

Left group:
- The central shapes are mostly filled in (except #2 and #3)
- The small squares are always touching the edges of the central shape
- There are usually 3-5 small squares arranged roughly evenly around the central shape

Right group:
- The central shapes are mostly hollow/outlined (except #3)
- Several of the small squares are not directly touching the central shape
- The small squares are often clustered on 2-3 sides of the central shape rather than evenly surrounding it
- There tend to be slightly more small squares (often 5-6)

So in summary, the left group has mostly filled central shapes with a few evenly spaced squares touching the edges, while the right group has mostly hollow shapes with more squares not always touching and clustered to the sides.

<answer>
The images in the left group contain mostly filled-in central shapes (circles, ovals, triangles) with 3-5 small squares evenly spaced around the edge of the shape and always touching it.

The images in the right group contain mostly hollow or outlined central shapes, with a larger number of small squares (often 5-6) that are not always touching the central shape directly, and tend to be clustered on 2-3 sides of the shape rather than evenly surrounding it.
