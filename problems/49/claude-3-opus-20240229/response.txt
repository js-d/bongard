Left group:
1. A circular shape made up of square pixels. 3 pixels inside the circle.
2. A square with 4 pixels inside, not touching the edges.
3. A triangular shape made of pixels, with 4 pixels scattered outside the triangle.
4. A circle made of pixels with 3 pixels inside, positioned towards the top of the circle.
5. An elliptical shape made of pixels, with 3 pixels scattered outside.
6. A circular arrangement of pixels with 3 pixels clustered in the center.

Right group:
1. An curved, elongated shape made of pixels with 3 pixels outside.
2. A roughly circular shape with pixels forming an imperfect perimeter. 5 pixels scattered inside the shape.
3. A circular arrangement of pixels with 4 pixels scattered outside the circle.
4. A diamond-like shape made of pixels with 5 pixels outside, mostly towards the bottom of the shape.
5. A triangular arrangement of pixels with 4 pixels outside, forming a smaller triangle.
6. A rectangular shape made of pixels with 3 pixels inside, towards one side of the rectangle.

<thinking>
The main difference seems to be whether the pixels are inside or outside the main shape.
In the left group, the pixels are always contained within the outer boundary shape.
In the right group, there are always some pixels outside or on the perimeter of the main shape.
The number of pixels and outer shape varies, but the inside/outside distinction is consistent.

<answer>
In the images on the left, the pixels are always fully contained inside the outer boundary shape. In the images on the right, there are always some pixels that fall outside or on the edge of the main shape formed by the pixels.
