Left group:
1. A single square with no interior details.
2. A single triangle pointing upwards with no interior details.
3. Two triangles, one pointing up and one pointing down, forming a six-pointed star shape with no interior details.
4. A single hexagon with no interior details.
5. Two overlapping squares forming an eight-pointed star shape with no interior details.
6. Two overlapping rectangles forming a cross shape with no interior details.

Right group:
1. A single circle with no interior details.
2. A single curved line with no endpoints visible within the frame.
3. A single circle with a dot in the center.
4. A single closed shape resembling a kidney bean or incomplete circle with no interior details.
5. A single ellipse with no interior details.
6. A single curved line segment with both endpoints visible within the frame.

<thinking>
The key difference between the left and right groups seems to be the types of lines and shapes used:

Left group: All shapes are composed of straight lines and have angles (polygons like squares, triangles, hexagons). The shapes are closed polygons or intersecting polygons.

Right group: All shapes are composed of curved lines with no angles (circles, ellipses, curved line segments). The shapes are closed curves, open curves, or have interior details like the dot.

So in summary, the left group contains only shapes made of straight lines and angles, while the right group contains only shapes made of curves with no angles.

<answer>
The images in the left group are all composed solely of straight lines forming closed polygons or intersecting polygons with angles, such as squares, triangles, and hexagons. In contrast, the images in the right group are all composed of curved lines with no angles, forming shapes like circles, ellipses, incomplete circles, and curved line segments.
