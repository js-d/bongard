Left group:
1. A single black square with no other shapes or features.
2. A black triangle pointing to the right.
3. A black triangle pointing to the right, with a horizontal line extending from its left vertex to form an incomplete rectangle or square shape.
4. A black hexagon or incomplete rectangle, with only the top, left, and bottom sides visible.
5. A black M-like shape, resembling two connected triangles or an incomplete hexagon missing the top side.
6. A black jagged shape resembling a lightning bolt or the letter Z turned on its side.

Right group:
1. A black circle with no other shapes or features.
2. A black curved line resembling a sideways S shape or a sine wave.
3. A single black circular shape, like a dot or filled-in circle.
4. Two overlapping black circles, like a Venn diagram, with the overlapping region also filled in black.
5. A black ellipse or oval shape, elongated horizontally.
6. A black kidney bean shape or an incomplete ellipse, with a concave curve on the right side.

The left group contains only polygonal shapes or combinations of straight lines, while the right group contains only curved shapes and lines. The left group features angles, vertices, and straight sides, whereas the right group has smooth curves and no sharp angles.

In the left group, the shapes progress from a simple square to more complex polygons and shapes made by combining triangles and removing sides. In the right group, the shapes evolve from a simple circle to more intricate curved shapes like ovals, ellipses, and curved lines.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the left group consists exclusively of polygonal shapes and straight lines, while the right group contains only curved shapes and lines. The shapes in the left group have angles, vertices, and straight sides, progressing from simple to more complex polygons. In contrast, the shapes in the right group feature smooth curves without sharp angles, evolving from a simple circle to more intricate curved shapes like ovals, ellipses, and curved lines.
