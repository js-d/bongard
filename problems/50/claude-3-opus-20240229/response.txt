Left group:
1. Two black circular shapes, one solid black equilateral triangle pointing up, and one solid black rectangle.
2. One hollow circular shape in the center, surrounded by four black right triangles pointing inward to form a square.
3. Two thin black right triangles stacked vertically to form an arrow pointing up, with their vertical sides touching.
4. One black home plate shape pointing down, with two small solid black squares on either side of the top vertex.
5. A hollow rhombus made of four black right triangles with their vertical sides touching, forming a diamond shape.
6. Two solid black circles stacked vertically with space between them, and two solid black squares stacked vertically with space between them, arranged in alternating order.

Right group:
1. Two solid black circles stacked vertically, one solid black equilateral triangle pointing up, one solid black equilateral triangle pointing down, and a solid black rectangle standing vertically.
2. One hollow equilateral triangle pointing up in the center, with two small solid black squares on either side of the top vertex.
3. One hollow circular shape, three solid black squares arranged with two stacked vertically on the left and one on the right, forming an L-shape.
4. One hollow square, one solid black equilateral triangle pointing up, and three solid black circles arranged in a triangle shape with one at the top and two at the bottom.
5. Two solid black equilateral triangles pointing up, stacked vertically with space between them.
6. One long vertical solid black rectangle.

<thinking>
The key differences between the left and right groups seem to be:
1. The left group has shapes arranged to form composite shapes, while the right group has individual shapes arranged in various configurations.
2. The left group uses mostly triangles and circles, while the right group includes more variety in shape types.
3. The left group has more symmetry and pattern in the arrangements, while the right group's arrangements are more asymmetrical and varied.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the left group contains composite shapes formed by arranging individual shapes together, often in symmetrical or patterned ways. The right group, on the other hand, features a variety of individual shapes arranged in less structured, more varied configurations that do not form distinct composite shapes.
