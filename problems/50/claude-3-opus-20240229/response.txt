Left group:
1. Two black circular shapes, one above the other, with a black triangular shape pointing down between them.
2. Four black shapes, two square-like shapes in the corners and two circular shapes in the middle, arranged in a diamond pattern with a circular hole in the center.
3. A black triangular shape pointing upward, with a horizontal line segment at its base.
4. A black home plate-shaped pentagon in the center, with two square shapes above it and one square shape below it.
5. A black diamond shape.
6. Two black circular shapes side by side, with two triangular shapes below them pointing downward.

Right group:
1. Two black circular shapes, one above the other, with a black triangular shape pointing up between them, and two line segments on either side of the triangular shape.
2. A black home plate-shaped pentagon, with two square shapes to the right of it.
3. A circular shape in the center, surrounded by 6 other shapes (4 square, 2 circular) arranged in a hexagonal pattern.
4. A square shape, with a triangular shape to its right, and two circular shapes above and below the triangular shape.
5. A black triangular shape pointing upward, with three line segments extending downward from its base at different angles.
6. A black rectangular shape, taller than it is wide, composed of two vertically stacked squares.

<thinking>
The main difference between the left and right groups seems to be the presence or absence of line segments or shapes extending from the main shapes. In the left group, the images are composed of basic shapes (circles, triangles, squares) without any extending parts. In the right group, each image has at least one shape with a line segment or another shape extending out from it.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is that the shapes in the left group are whole and self-contained, while the shapes in the right group have parts or lines extending out from the main shape. The left group features basic geometric shapes like circles, triangles, and squares, whereas the right group has these same basic shapes but with additional lines or smaller shapes connected to or extending from them.
