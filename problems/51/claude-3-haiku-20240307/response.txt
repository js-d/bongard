Analyzing the images in the 'left' group:

1. The image contains several small, irregularly shaped black shapes scattered throughout a white background.
2. The shapes are mostly circular or oval-like in form, with varying sizes and positions on the canvas.
3. The shapes are unevenly distributed, with some areas having a higher concentration of shapes than others.
4. The spacing between the shapes is also uneven, with some shapes closer together and others further apart.
5. There is no clear pattern or organization to the placement of the shapes.

Analyzing the images in the 'right' group:

1. The image contains several small, roughly circular black shapes scattered throughout a white background.
2. The shapes are more uniform in size and shape compared to the 'left' group images.
3. The shapes are more evenly distributed across the canvas, with a more consistent spacing between them.
4. There is a slight sense of organization or pattern to the placement of the shapes, with some forming loose clusters or alignments.
5. The overall composition of the 'right' group images appears more structured and organized compared to the 'left' group.

Differences between the 'left' and 'right' groups:

The main differences between the two groups are:
1. The shapes in the 'left' group are more irregular and varied in size and shape, while the 'right' group has more uniform, circular shapes.
2. The placement of the shapes in the 'left' group is more scattered and uneven, while the 'right' group has a more organized and structured arrangement.
3. The 'left' group appears more chaotic and random, while the 'right' group has a greater sense of order and pattern.

<answer>
The key difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group of images is the degree of organization and structure in the placement of the black shapes.

The 'left' group images have a more chaotic and random distribution of the shapes, with varying sizes, shapes, and uneven spacing between the shapes. There is no clear pattern or organization to the placement of the shapes.

In contrast, the 'right' group images have a more organized and structured arrangement of the shapes. The shapes are more uniform in size and shape, and their placement is more evenly distributed across the canvas, with a slightly greater sense of clustering or alignment between the shapes.

The 'right' group images exhibit a greater degree of order and pattern compared to the more random and chaotic 'left' group.
