Left group:
1. Three black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged roughly vertically with spacing between them.
2. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged roughly in a diamond pattern with the top shape slightly offset.
3. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a curved line starting from the top left.
4. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a diagonal line from top left to bottom right.
5. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a slight arc from top left to bottom right.
6. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a square pattern.

Right group:
1. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a diamond pattern with one shape at the top.
2. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged vertically with the top and bottom shapes slightly offset.
3. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged roughly in a square but slightly more vertical.
4. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a triangular pattern with one shape at the top.
5. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a rough square pattern.
6. Four black irregular shapes on a white background, arranged in a diamond pattern but slightly more horizontal.

<thinking>
- The left group images contain 3-4 shapes, while all right group images contain 4 shapes.
- The shapes in the left group are generally arranged in lines or curves, while the right group shapes form more closed patterns like diamonds and squares.
- It seems like the key difference is that the right group shapes create enclosed areas, while the left group shapes do not.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the irregular shapes in the right group images are arranged in a way that encloses an area, forming diamond or square-like patterns. In contrast, the shapes in the left group are arranged in open lines or curves and do not enclose a space between them.
