To describe the images in the left and right groups, I will focus on the shape, curvature, and overall structure of the pixelated shapes in each image. I will analyze the similarities and differences between the groups to determine the underlying pattern or rule that distinguishes them.

Left group:
1. A curved, elongated shape with a jagged, irregular outline.
2. A curved, elongated shape with a smooth, continuous outline.
3. An oval-like shape with a smooth, continuous outline.
4. A curved, elongated shape with a jagged, irregular outline.
5. A curved, elongated shape with a smooth, continuous outline.
6. A wavy, undulating shape with a smooth, continuous outline.

Right group:
1. A curved, elongated shape with a smooth, continuous outline.
2. A curved, elongated shape with a smooth, continuous outline and a smaller, hooked protrusion.
3. A curved, elongated shape with a smooth, continuous outline and a smaller, hooked protrusion.
4. A curved, elongated shape with a smooth, continuous outline and a smaller, hooked protrusion.
5. A curved, elongated shape with a smooth, continuous outline and a smaller, hooked protrusion.
6. A curved, elongated shape with a smooth, continuous outline and a smaller, hooked protrusion.

<thinking>
The key difference between the two groups is the presence or absence of a smaller, hooked protrusion at the end of the curved, elongated shapes in the right group. All the images in the left group have shapes without this additional protrusion, while all the images in the right group have shapes with the smaller, hooked protrusion.

<answer>
The left group contains images with curved, elongated shapes that have either a jagged, irregular outline or a smooth, continuous outline, but none of the shapes have a smaller, hooked protrusion. The right group contains images with curved, elongated shapes that all have a smaller, hooked protrusion at the end of the shape, in addition to a smooth, continuous outline.
