Let's analyze the images in the left group:

Left group:
1. The image shows a black triangle with a black triangle inside it, forming a frame-like structure.
2. This image displays a black triangle with a black inverted triangle inside it, creating a symmetrical shape.
3. The image depicts a black triangle with a black triangle shape inside it, giving a nested appearance.
4. This image shows a black hexagon shape with a smaller black triangle shape inside it.
5. The image portrays a black irregular polygon shape with a smaller black polygon shape inside it.
6. This image displays a black irregular polygon shape with a smaller black triangle shape inside it.

Now, let's analyze the images in the right group:

Right group:
1. The image shows a black triangle with a smaller black circle shape inside it.
2. This image displays a black square shape with a smaller black hexagon shape inside it.
3. The image depicts a black triangle with a smaller black square shape inside it.
4. This image shows a black triangle shape with a smaller black triangle shape inside it, but the inner triangle is rotated compared to the outer one.
5. The image portrays a black triangle shape with a smaller black square shape inside it, but the inner square is placed off-center.
6. This image displays a black irregular polygon shape with a smaller black oval shape inside it.

The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group all have a nested, frame-like structure where the inner shape is of the same type as the outer shape (e.g., triangle within a triangle, hexagon within a polygon). In contrast, the images in the right group have a more varied structure, where the inner shape is different from the outer shape (e.g., circle within a triangle, square within a triangle).
