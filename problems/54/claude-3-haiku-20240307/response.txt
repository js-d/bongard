Let's analyze the 12 images step-by-step:

Left group:
1. The image contains a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle.
2. The image contains a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle.
3. The image contains a triangle.
4. The image contains a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle.
5. The image contains a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle.
6. The image contains a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle.

Right group:
1. The image contains a circle and a plus sign.
2. The image contains a triangle and a circle.
3. The image contains a circle.
4. The image contains a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle.
5. The image contains a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle.
6. The image contains a triangle and a plus sign.

The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group all contain a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle, while the images in the right group have more variation, with some containing only a subset of these shapes.

<answer>
The difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the left group all contain the same three shapes - a plus sign, a triangle, and a circle. In contrast, the images in the right group have more variation, with some containing only a subset of these three shapes.
