Examining the images in the left group:

1. The image appears to be a black and white pixel-art representation of an irregular, angular shape with a protrusion on one side.
2. This image depicts a triangular shape with a curved, jagged edge on one side.
3. The image shows a circular shape with a line extending out of it, forming a curved, hook-like structure.
4. This image presents a circular shape with a small, elongated appendage protruding from it.
5. The image displays a triangular shape with a curved, hook-like structure extending from one of the corners.
6. This image shows an irregularly shaped, angular form with a smaller shape attached to it.

Examining the images in the right group:

1. The image depicts a spiral or coiled shape with a small, hook-like protrusion at the end.
2. This image shows a rectangular shape with a smaller, curved structure attached to one of the corners.
3. The image presents a circular shape with a curved, hook-like appendage extending from it.
4. This image displays a spiral or coiled shape with a small, hook-like structure at the end.
5. The image shows a triangular shape with a curved, hook-like protrusion extending from one of the corners.
6. This image depicts an irregular, angular shape with a smaller, triangular form attached to it.

Analyzing the differences between the left and right groups:

The main difference between the two groups is the presence or absence of a curved, hook-like structure. All the images in the left group lack this curved, hook-like element, while all the images in the right group contain a curved, hook-like structure as a prominent feature.
