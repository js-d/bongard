Examining the images in the left group:

1. The image contains 3 small, black triangle shapes arranged vertically.
2. The image contains 2 small, black triangle shapes arranged vertically.
3. The image contains 3 small, black triangle shapes arranged vertically.
4. The image contains various small, black shapes including triangles and circles.
5. The image contains a large, black triangle shape and a small, black circle shape.
6. The image contains 2 large, black triangle shapes arranged vertically.

Examining the images in the right group:

1. The image contains 2 small, black circular shapes and a small, black triangle shape.
2. The image contains 1 small, black circular shape.
3. The image contains 2 small, black circular shapes and a small, black triangle shape.
4. The image contains 3 small, black circular shapes and a small, black triangle shape.
5. The image contains 1 large, black triangle shape and 1 small, black circular shape.
6. The image contains 1 large, black triangle shape and 1 small, black circular shape.

The key difference between the left group and the right group appears to be the shapes present in the images. The left group contains primarily triangle shapes, while the right group contains a mix of circular and triangle shapes. Additionally, the size and arrangement of the shapes differ between the two groups - the left group has more consistent size and vertical arrangement of the triangle shapes, while the right group has more varied size and arrangement of the circular and triangle shapes.

The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group is the shape composition. The images in the left group contain primarily triangle shapes, with consistent size and vertical arrangement. In contrast, the images in the right group contain a mix of circular and triangle shapes, with more varied size and arrangement.
