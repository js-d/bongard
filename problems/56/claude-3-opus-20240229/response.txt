Left group:
1. Triangle shape made of three small black circles.
2. Two black shapes - a triangle and a small circle separate from each other.
3. Triangle pointing up above a small circle, and another small circle to the left of the triangle.
4. Three black shapes - a triangle, a circle below it, and another circle to the right of the triangle.
5. Triangle above a circle.
6. Triangle above and to the right of a circle.

Right group:
1. Two black circles above a triangle shape.
2. Three black shapes - two small circles above a larger triangle shape.
3. Triangle below a circle, and another small circle to the right of the triangle.
4. Triangle below and to the left of a circle.
5. Triangle shape to the left of a circle.
6. Four black shapes arranged in a diamond - a triangle, two circles, and an upside-down triangle.

<thinking>
The key difference seems to be the relative positioning of the triangle and circle shapes:
- In the left group, the triangle is always above or to the upper right of any circles. The triangle points upwards.
- In the right group, the triangle is always below or to the lower left of any circles. The triangle points downwards.
The number of shapes varies in each image, but the positioning rule holds true across all images in each group.

<answer>
In the left group images, the triangle shape always points upwards and is positioned above or to the upper right of any circles.
In the right group images, the triangle shape always points downwards and is positioned below or to the lower left of any circles.
