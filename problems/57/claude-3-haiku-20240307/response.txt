Let's analyze the images in the 'left' group and the 'right' group separately, then compare the differences between them.

Left group:
1. This image shows a black triangle pointing upwards.
2. This image also shows a black triangle pointing upwards, but it is smaller than the one in the first image.
3. This image displays two irregular polygon shapes that are connected at an angle.
4. This image shows two circular shapes, one larger than the other.
5. This image depicts two amorphous, irregularly-shaped black blobs.
6. This image displays two black triangles that are pointing in opposite directions.

Right group:
1. This image shows a single black circle.
2. This image depicts a black triangle pointing upwards.
3. This image displays two black triangles that are pointing in opposite directions.
4. This image shows a large black square and a smaller black square.
5. This image depicts a large black circle and a smaller black circle.
6. This image displays a jagged, irregular black shape and a circular black shape.

The main difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group is that the 'left' group images contain multiple shapes or elements, while the 'right' group images contain either a single shape or two related shapes. Additionally, the shapes in the 'left' group tend to be more irregular and amorphous, while the shapes in the 'right' group are more geometric and defined.

<answer>
The key difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group is the number and complexity of the shapes within each image. The 'left' group images all contain multiple shapes or elements, while the 'right' group images either have a single shape or two related shapes.

Additionally, the shapes in the 'left' group tend to be more irregular and amorphous, while the shapes in the 'right' group are more geometric and defined. For example, the 'left' group includes images with connected polygons, blobs, and irregularly-shaped triangles, while the 'right' group has simple circles, triangles, squares, and other basic geometric shapes.
