Left group:
1. A single black equilateral triangle pointing upwards on a white background.
2. Two identical black squares, arranged vertically, with some white space between them, on a white background.
3. Two triangular black shapes pointing to the right, arranged diagonally, on a white background.
4. A small black circle above a larger black circle, with some white space between them, on a white background.
5. A large black curved shape, concave side facing down, with a smaller black curved shape nested inside it, concave side facing up, on a white background.
6. Two triangular black shapes pointing to the right, arranged horizontally with some space between them, on a white background.

Right group:
1. A small black circle above a larger black triangular shape pointing down, on a white background.
2. A small black triangular shape pointing to the right, and a larger black triangular shape pointing to the right placed to the upper-right of the smaller shape, on a white background.
3. A small black circle to the right of a larger black circle, on a white background.
4. A black square, with a smaller black square placed to the upper-right of the larger square with some white space between them, on a white background.
5. A black triangular shape pointing to the right, with a smaller black circle placed to the upper-right of the triangular shape, on a white background.
6. A black square, with a smaller black triangular shape pointing up placed above and to the right of the square, on a white background.

<thinking>
In the left group, the images contain shapes that are either identical (two squares, two triangles, two circles, two curved shapes) or a single shape (one triangle). The shapes are arranged vertically, diagonally, horizontally, or nested within each other.

In the right group, the images contain two different shapes (circle and triangle, two different sized triangles, circle and square, two different sized squares, triangle and circle, square and triangle). The smaller shape is always placed to the upper-right of the larger shape with some white space between them.

The key difference seems to be that in the left group, the shapes are identical or singular, while in the right group, there are always two different shapes with the smaller one placed in a specific position relative to the larger one.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is:
In the left group, the images contain either identical shapes or a single shape, arranged in various orientations (vertically, diagonally, horizontally, or nested).
In the right group, the images always contain two different shapes, with the smaller shape consistently placed to the upper-right of the larger shape, with some white space between them.
