Let me analyze the images in detail to find the differences between the 'left' and 'right' groups.

Left group:
1. A solid black square.
2. A solid black triangle.
3. A solid black square with a smaller solid black square inside it.
4. A solid black square with a smaller solid black triangle inside it.
5. A solid black square with a smaller solid black square and a smaller solid black triangle inside it.
6. A solid black square with a smaller solid black square and a smaller solid black triangle inside it, but the arrangement is different from the previous image.

Right group:
1. A solid black triangle and a solid black square.
2. A solid black triangle and a smaller solid black square.
3. A solid black square and a smaller solid black triangle.
4. A solid black square and a smaller solid black triangle, but the arrangement is different from the previous image.
5. A solid black square and a smaller solid black square.
6. A larger solid black square and a smaller solid black square.

The main difference between the 'left' and 'right' groups is that the images in the 'left' group all contain nested shapes within a single larger shape, while the images in the 'right' group contain two separate shapes.
