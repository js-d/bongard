Left group:
1. A single square and a right-angled triangle pointing up and to the right.
2. Two squares, one above a larger one.
3. Four small squares arranged in a larger square formation, with one square missing from the lower right corner.
4. A right-angled triangle pointing right, followed by two squares.
5. A right-angled triangle pointing up, three squares arranged in an L-shape.
6. Two squares side-by-side, a right-angled triangle pointing down, and another square below the triangle.

Right group:
1. A right-angled triangle pointing up, a square, a right-angled triangle pointing down, and another square, all arranged vertically.
2. A right-angled triangle pointing right, a square to its right, and two more squares below forming a square shape.
3. A square, two squares side-by-side to its right, and a single square below the left square in the pair.
4. A right-angled triangle pointing right, two squares arranged vertically to its right.
5. Two squares, one above the other, followed by a single square to their right.
6. A single square followed by two squares, one above the other, to its right.

<thinking>
The left group images all contain shapes that connect to form a single polygon or continuous line. The squares and triangles touch at their edges or corners to create a cohesive shape.

In contrast, the right group images have shapes that are disconnected or separated from each other. There are gaps between the squares and triangles, and they do not form a continuous polygon.

<answer>
The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group contain shapes that connect to form a single continuous polygon or line, while the images in the right group have shapes that are disconnected or separated from each other with gaps between them.
