To analyze the 12 images, I will describe each image in the left group and the right group, and then explain the difference between the two groups.

Left group:
1. The image contains two black triangles.
2. The image contains a large rectangle and a smaller rectangle.
3. The image contains a small square and a larger circle.
4. The image contains two large circles.
5. The image contains a curvy shape with a smaller shape inside.
6. The image contains an elongated shape with a smaller shape at the end.

Right group:
1. The image contains a black triangle and a black circle.
2. The image contains a large oval shape.
3. The image contains a large oval shape with a smaller shape inside.
4. The image contains two large oval shapes.
5. The image contains a circle and a rectangle.
6. The image contains a large elongated shape with a smaller shape at the end.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is the overall shape and complexity of the shapes. The images in the left group tend to have more complex and irregular shapes, while the images in the right group have simpler and more geometric shapes.

<answer>
The key difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group is the complexity of the shapes. The images in the 'left' group tend to have more complex and irregular shapes, while the images in the 'right' group have simpler and more geometric shapes.
