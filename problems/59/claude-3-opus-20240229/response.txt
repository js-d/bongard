Left group:
1. A black triangle and a black circle, not touching each other, on a white background.
2. A black rectangle and a smaller black square next to it, not touching, on a white background.
3. A black circle with a small black square overlapping/touching its lower right side, on a white background.
4. Two black circles, one larger and one smaller, not touching each other, on a white background.
5. A black jagged/uneven shape and a smaller black square next to it, not touching, on a white background.
6. Two black ovals/circles, almost the same size, not quite touching each other, on a white background.

Right group:
1. A black triangle touching/overlapping a black circle on its right side, on a white background.
2. A black blob/amoeba-like shape with a triangle cut out/missing from its center, on a white background.
3. Two black ovals/circles, one larger and one smaller, touching and slightly overlapping each other, on a white background.
4. A black circle and a black square next to it, barely touching, on a white background.
5. A black rectangle with a smaller black square overlapping/inside its right side, on a white background.
6. A black jagged/uneven shape with a smaller black square overlapping/inside its right side, on a white background.

<thinking>
In the left group, the shapes are not touching or overlapping each other. They are separate shapes next to one another.
In the right group, the shapes are touching or overlapping in some way. Either one shape is inside or on top of another, or the two shapes are connected.
So the key difference seems to be whether the two shapes in each image are separated or connected/overlapping in some manner.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and right group is:
In the left group, the two shapes in each image are not touching or overlapping. They are distinctly separate shapes positioned next to each other.
In the right group, the two shapes in each image are touching, overlapping, or one shape is inside the other. The shapes are connected or intersecting in some way, not completely separate.
