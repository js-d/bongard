Left group:
1. A black equilateral triangle on a white background, with the point facing upwards.
2. A black right triangle on a white background, with the right angle in the bottom right and the hypotenuse angled from bottom left to top right.
3. Two black line segments on a white background, meeting at a 45 degree angle with the point at the top, resembling a thin upward facing arrow shape.
4. A small solid black equilateral triangle on a white background with the point facing upwards.
5. Two black line segments on a white background in the shape of a tall isosceles triangle, with the point at the top and equal angles at the base.
6. A black equilateral triangle on a white background, with the point facing downwards.

Right group:
1. A small solid black square in the top right corner of a white rectangular background.
2. A black outline of a right triangle on a white background, with the right angle at the top left and the hypotenuse angled from top left to bottom right.
3. A black outline of a rectangle on a white background.
4. A black outline of a trapezoid on a white background, with the shorter parallel side at the top.
5. A small solid black diamond shape on a white background, resembling a rhombus or tilted square.
6. A black outline of a rectangle on a white background, wider than it is tall.

<thinking>
The left group images all contain triangular shapes or shapes composed of angled line segments. The right group images contain more rectangular shapes or shapes with parallel sides and right angles.

The left group shapes all have at least one pointed end or corner, while the right group shapes have no sharp points and more rounded or 90 degree corners.

The left group has a mix of outlined and solid black shapes, while the right group shapes are all outlines except for one small solid shape.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right image groups is that the left group contains triangular and pointed shapes, while the right group contains rectangular and parallel-sided shapes. The left group shapes all have at least one sharp, angled point, while the right group shapes are composed of right angles and parallel lines with no sharp points. Additionally, the left group has a mix of outlined and filled-in black shapes, while the right group is almost entirely black outlines with only one small solid black shape.
