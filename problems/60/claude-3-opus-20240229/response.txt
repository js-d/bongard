Left group:
1. A single black square with a white triangle pointing downward to the right.
2. Two black squares, one larger on the left and one smaller on the right.
3. Two black triangles pointing downward, one larger on the left and one smaller on the right.
4. A black circle on the left and a black triangle pointing right on the right.
5. A black square on the left, a black circle in the middle, and a black rectangle on the right.
6. Three shapes in a row - a black circle on the left, two black squares in the middle and on the right.

Right group:
1. A black triangle pointing downward on the left and a black circle on the right.
2. Two black squares, one on the left and one on the right, with a black triangle pointing right in between.
3. A black circle on the left and a black square on the right.
4. Two black rectangles, one vertical on the left and one horizontal on the right.
5. Three shapes forming a triangle - a black square on the top left, a black triangle pointing left on the top right, and a black rectangle on the bottom.
6. A black triangle pointing right on the left and a black circle on the right.

<thinking>
In the left group, the shapes seem to represent a hierarchy or progression, with the leftmost shape being the largest or most dominant, and the shapes to the right being smaller or subordinate.

In the right group, the shapes seem to be more scattered and disconnected from each other. There is no clear hierarchy or relationship between the shapes.

The key difference appears to be that in the left group, the shapes are organized in a meaningful, hierarchical way, while in the right group they are more randomly arranged without a clear structure or relationship.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is the arrangement and relationship of the shapes. In the left group images, the shapes are organized in a hierarchical, ordered way, with the leftmost shape being the largest or most dominant, and the shapes decreasing in size or importance as you move to the right. This suggests a progression or subordinate relationship between the shapes.

In contrast, the right group images have shapes that are more randomly scattered and do not appear to have a meaningful relationship or hierarchy. The placement of the shapes seems arbitrary and does not convey a sense of order or structure like in the left group.
