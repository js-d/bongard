The 12 images presented are part of a Bongard problem, which is a type of visual reasoning task that requires identifying the distinguishing features between two groups of images. To solve this problem, I will carefully analyze and describe each of the 12 images, and then identify the key differences between the 'left' and 'right' groups.

Left group:
1. The image shows a set of three plus signs (+) arranged horizontally, with a horizontal line underneath.
2. The image shows a series of plus signs (+) arranged in a diagonal pattern, with a horizontal line underneath.
3. The image shows a series of plus signs (+) arranged in a vertical pattern, with a horizontal line underneath.
4. The image shows a single plus sign (+) in the center, with smaller plus signs (+) arranged around it in a circular pattern.
5. The image shows a single plus sign (+) in the center, with smaller plus signs (+) arranged around it in a diagonal pattern.
6. The image shows a series of plus signs (+) arranged in a diagonal pattern, with a longer horizontal line underneath.

Right group:
1. The image shows a single plus sign (+) on the left, with a long diagonal line extending from it to the right.
2. The image shows a series of plus signs (+) arranged in a horizontal pattern, with a longer horizontal line underneath.
3. The image shows a series of plus signs (+) arranged in a diagonal pattern, with a longer horizontal line underneath.
4. The image shows a series of plus signs (+) arranged in a scattered pattern, with a longer horizontal line underneath.
5. The image shows a series of plus signs (+) arranged in a diagonal pattern, with a longer diagonal line extending from the top left to the bottom right.
6. The image shows a series of plus signs (+) arranged in a diagonal pattern, with a longer diagonal line extending from the top right to the bottom left.

The key difference between the 'left' and 'right' groups is the presence of a diagonal line or pattern in the 'right' group images. All of the 'right' group images contain at least one diagonal line or element, while the 'left' group images are characterized by more symmetric, geometric arrangements of the plus signs (+) and horizontal lines.
