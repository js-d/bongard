Left group:
1. Two crosses, one above the other, with the top cross positioned slightly to the left.
2. Several crosses of varying sizes scattered at angles, with a horizontal line through the middle.
3. Many crosses of different sizes at various angles filling the rectangular space.
4. Two crosses, one larger at a slant and a smaller one positioned horizontally at the top.
5. A diagonal line of crosses with the size increasing from top left to bottom right.
6. Two angled lines of crosses that intersect near the middle, forming an X shape.

Right group:
1. A vertical line with a cross to the left and another cross to the right of the line.
2. Four crosses arranged in a square formation with a horizontal line through the middle.
3. Several crosses of varying sizes arranged vertically, with a vertical line through them.
4. Multiple crosses of different sizes filling a triangular area, with three crosses in a line on the right.
5. Three crosses and a short line segment arranged to resemble a person shooting a gun.
6. Multiple crosses of varying sizes scattered in the image, with a curved line passing through the middle.

<thinking>
The left group images contain only crosses, while the right group images have crosses along with lines.
The crosses in the left group seem more randomly arranged, while the right group tends to have more structured/patterned arrangements of crosses, often in relation to the lines.
The left group focuses solely on the composition of crosses, while the right group explores the interaction between crosses and lines.

<answer>
The key difference between the left group and right group of images is the inclusion of lines in the right group. The left group consists solely of crosses of varying quantities, sizes, and arrangements. In contrast, the right group features crosses interacting with lines in different ways, such as crosses positioned along a line, arranged around a line, or with a line passing through the composition of crosses. The left group focuses on the composition and arrangement of crosses alone, while the right group explores the relationship between crosses and lines in each image.
