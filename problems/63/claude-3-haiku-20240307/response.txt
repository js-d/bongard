To analyze the images, I'll first describe each one in the left group, then the right group, and finally explain the key difference between the two groups.

Left group:
1. A simple black square shape.
2. An oval-like shape made up of black pixels.
3. A wave-like shape made up of black pixels.
4. A diamond-like shape made up of black pixels.
5. A curvy, spiral-like shape made up of black pixels.
6. A T-shaped figure made up of black pixels.

Right group:
1. An oval-like shape made up of black pixels.
2. A wave-like shape made up of black pixels, similar to the third image in the left group.
3. A square-like shape made up of black pixels, with a rectangular cut-out in the middle.
4. A hexagon-like shape made up of black pixels.
5. A curvy, spiral-like shape, similar to the fifth image in the left group.
6. An oval-like shape made up of black pixels, similar to the first image in the right group.

The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group all have a single, continuous shape, while the images in the right group have more complex shapes, with some featuring internal cutouts or additional elements within the main shape.
