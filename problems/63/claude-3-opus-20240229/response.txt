Left group:
1. A simple black rectangular shape on a white background.
2. An oval shape made up of small black squares on a white background.
3. An hourglass-like shape made of two oval shapes connected at a single point, on a white background.
4. A diamond shape made of a pixelated outline on a white background.
5. An irregular angular shape that looks like a blocky "L", made of black squares on a white background.
6. A thicker, slightly curved shape that resembles a backwards "S", made of black squares on a white background.

Right group:
1. A circular shape made of a thin black outline on a white background.
2. An apple-like shape made of a black outline with a bite taken out of the right side, on a white background.
3. A thick blocky "H" shape made of black filled-in rectangles on a white background.
4. An octagon shape made of a black pixelated outline on a white background.
5. An outline of the lower half of a human brain in profile view, made of a black outline on a white background.
6. An egg-like shape made of a black outline on a white background.

<thinking>
The left group images all appear to be made up of black filled-in shapes or outlines composed of small squares or rectangles. They are more angular, blocky, and pixelated in appearance.

The right group images are all made of thin black outlines forming mostly curved or rounded shapes. They have smoother edges and no filled-in areas, just outlines.

So the key difference seems to be:
Left group - filled in pixelated shapes
Right group - thin curved outlines

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the left group images consist of filled-in, pixelated, blocky shapes made up of black squares and rectangles, while the right group images are composed of thin, smooth, curved outlines of various shapes with no fill. The left group has a more angular, jagged, digital appearance while the right group has an organic, rounded, analog look.
