To analyze the images in the left and right groups, I will look at each image carefully and describe its key features.

Left group:
1. The image shows a simple oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller 'x' shape below it.
2. This image contains a simple oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller 'x' shape below it, similar to the first image.
3. This image has an oval shape pointing to the right, with a small circular shape below it.
4. The image has an oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller 'x' shape below it, similar to the first two images.
5. This image contains an oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller '+' shape below it.
6. The image shows an oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller circular shape below it.

Right group:
1. This image has an oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller '+' shape below it and a smaller circular shape to the right.
2. The image contains a single circular shape.
3. This image has an oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller '+' shape below it and a smaller circular shape to the right.
4. The image shows an oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller '+' shape below it and a smaller circular shape to the right.
5. This image contains an oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller '+' shape below it and a smaller circular shape to the left.
6. The image has an oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller '+' shape below it and a smaller circular shape to the right.

The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group all have the oval shape pointing to the right, while the images in the right group have the oval shape pointing to the right but also have additional shapes ('+', circular) in different positions around the oval.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is the presence of additional shapes around the central oval shape.

The images in the left group all have a simple oval shape pointing to the right, with a smaller shape (x, circle, +) positioned below the oval.

In contrast, the images in the right group also have the oval shape pointing to the right, but they also have additional smaller shapes (circles, +) positioned around the oval, either to the right, left, or both.

So the main distinguishing feature is the presence of these additional shapes around the oval in the right group, which is not present in the left group.
