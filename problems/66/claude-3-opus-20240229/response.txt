Left group:
1. A tree-like structure with a central "trunk" made of 3 connected nodes, and 7 "branches" extending from it, each consisting of a single node.
2. A more complex tree-like structure with a central "trunk" of 4 connected nodes, and 8 "branches" coming off of it at various points, each branch being 1-2 nodes long.
3. Another tree-like structure, with a short 2-node "trunk" and 6 single-node "branches" extending from the top node of the trunk.
4. A highly branched tree-like structure, with a 3-node central "trunk" and 10 "branches" of varying lengths (1-3 nodes each) coming off the trunk nodes.
5. A complex tree-like structure with a 4-node "trunk" and 10 "branches" of varying lengths and complexity coming off of it. The branches connect to the trunk at various points.
6. A tree-like structure with a zig-zag "trunk" composed of 5 nodes and 9 single-node "branches" extending from the trunk nodes.

Right group:
1. An interconnected structure with no clear central "trunk". It contains many loops and circuits, with 13 nodes in total all connecting in a complex web.
2. A highly interconnected structure containing 15 nodes with many loops and circuits. No central linear structure or "trunk".
3. A circular, highly interconnected structure with 14 nodes and many loops within the overall circular arrangement of nodes.
4. An complexly interconnected structure with 13 nodes arranged roughly in a circular shape, with many cross-connections and circuits within the overall circular structure.
5. A complexly interconnected group of 12 nodes with many loops and circuits. Arranged in a roughly circular overall shape.
6. A highly interconnected, somewhat circular arrangement of 14 nodes with many cross-connections and loops between the nodes.

The key difference I notice between the left and right groups is the overall structure and arrangement of the nodes and connections:

Left group: Tree-like structures. They have a clear central linear "trunk" of connected nodes, with "branches" extending out from the trunk. The branches do not connect to each other, only to the trunk. No loops or circuits.

Right group: Web-like or circular structures. The nodes are highly interconnected with many cross-connections, forming loops and circuits. There is no clear linear "trunk" structure. The overall arrangement tends to be circular rather than linear.

So in summary, the key differences are:
Left: Tree structures (linear trunk with branches, no loops)
Right: Web or circle structures (highly interconnected nodes, many loops)

<answer>
The images in the left group all depict tree-like structures, with a clear central "trunk" of linearly connected nodes, and "branches" extending out from the trunk. The branches connect to the trunk but not to each other, and there are no loops or circuits.

In contrast, the images in the right group show highly interconnected web-like or circular structures, where the nodes connect to each other in many directions, forming loops and circuits. There is no clear linear "trunk" and "branch" structure as in the left group.
