Left group:
1. A pixelated branch or twig with two short offshoots, on a white background.
2. Similar to image 1, but the lower offshoot is slightly longer.
3. The branch now has three offshoots, with the middle one being the longest.
4. The branch curves downward and has three offshoots of increasing length from top to bottom.
5. The branch curves more prominently downward. The offshoots increase in length from top to bottom.
6. The downward curving branch now has four offshoots of increasing length from top to bottom.

Right group:
1. A short vertical branch with a smaller offshoot coming off the left side near the top.
2. The main branch is slightly taller. The left offshoot is lower and angled slightly downward.
3. The main branch is taller still. There are now two angled offshoots on the left side.
4. The vertical branch is taller. The two left offshoots are longer and angled more downward.
5. The main branch has grown even taller. There are now three downward angled left offshoots of increasing length.
6. The vertical branch is at its tallest. A fourth downward left offshoot has been added at the bottom, longer than the others.

<thinking>
The key differences between the left and right groups seem to be:

Left group:
- The main branch is curved and arcing downward
- Offshoots emerge from the outer/lower side of the curve
- Offshoots increase in length along the curve

Right group:
- The main branch is straight and vertical
- Offshoots emerge from the left side of the vertical branch
- Offshoots are angled downward to the left and increase in length down the branch

The left group shows a curving, drooping branch, while the right group shows an upright branch. But both exhibit offshoots of increasing length in the direction the branch is "growing".

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right image groups is the orientation and curvature of the primary branch. In the left group, the branch curves and arcs downward, with offshoots emerging from the outer/lower side of the curve and increasing in length. In the right group, the branch is straight and vertical, with offshoots coming off the left side at downward angles, also increasing in length. So the left group depicts a drooping branch, while the right shows an upright one, but both demonstrate a similar growth pattern of the offshoots.
