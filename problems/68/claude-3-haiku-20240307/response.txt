Analyzing the images in the left group:

1. This image shows a simple curved line shape with a smaller protrusion or branch extending upwards from the main curve.

2. This image shows a more complex curved shape with multiple bends and a sharper, more jagged protrusion extending upwards from the main curve.

3. This image shows a similar curved shape to the previous one, but with a longer, more gradually sloping protrusion extending upwards from the main curve.

4. This image shows a curved shape with a prominent, sharp protrusion extending upwards from the main curve.

5. This image shows a curved shape with a shorter, more abrupt protrusion extending upwards from the main curve.

6. This image shows a curved shape with a longer, more gradual protrusion extending upwards from the main curve, with a smaller secondary protrusion near the top.

Analyzing the images in the right group:

1. This image shows a curved shape with a single, sharp protrusion extending upwards from the main curve.

2. This image shows a curved shape with a single, shorter protrusion extending upwards from the main curve.

3. This image shows a curved shape with a single, longer protrusion extending upwards from the main curve.

4. This image shows a curved shape with multiple, shorter protrusions extending upwards from the main curve.

5. This image shows a curved shape with a single, more jagged protrusion extending upwards from the main curve.

6. This image shows a curved shape with a single, longer protrusion extending upwards from the main curve, with a smaller secondary protrusion near the top.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is the number and complexity of the protrusions extending upwards from the main curved shape. The left group images generally have more complex, multi-part protrusions, while the right group images have simpler, single-part protrusions.
