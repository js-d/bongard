Left group:
1. A branching plant-like structure with a long stem and two branches on the right side. The stem and branches are composed of small square pixels.
2. Similar branching structure but with three branches on the right side of the main stem. The stem is slightly curved.
3. The branching structure now has four branches coming off the right side of the main stem, which has a slight curve to the left at the top.
4. The branching structure has three branches, but they alternate sides, with one on the left, then one on the right, then the last branch on the left again.
5. A more complex branching structure with five branches alternating sides. The main stem has a slight S-curve.
6. The most complex branching structure in the left group, with six branches alternating sides off the main curved stem.

Right group:
1. A simple curved branch or root-like structure, curving down and to the right. Composed of small square pixels.
2. Similar curved structure, but with a single branch coming off the left side of the main curved section.
3. The curved structure now has two branches off the left side, resembling a two-fingered claw or paw print.
4. Three branches now come off the left side of the main curved section, increasing in length from top to bottom.
5. The branched, curved structure now has three branches on the left side, but the bottommost branch curves upward slightly.
6. The curved structure is the most complex in the right group, with four branches of increasing size coming off the left side of the main section, and the bottommost branch curving upward.

The main differences I notice between the left and right groups are:
1. The left group all have straight main stems, while the right group have curved main sections.
2. In the left group, the branches all come off the right side of the main stem, while in the right group, they all come off the left side of the main curved section.
3. The left group starts with a simple unbranched structure and progressively adds more branches, up to 6. The right group also becomes more complex, but maxes out at 4 branches.
4. The branches in the left group are straight, while in the right group, the bottommost branch in the last two images curves upward.

<answer>
The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group have straight main stems with branches coming off the right side, while the images in the right group have curved main sections with branches coming off the left side. Both groups start simple and add complexity, but the left group adds more branches (up to 6) while the right group has fewer (up to 4), and introduces slight curvature to the bottommost branch in the last two images.
