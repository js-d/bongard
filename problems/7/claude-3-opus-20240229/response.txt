Left group:
1. A single vertical line that curves to the left at the top.
2. A zigzag line with 7 sharp angles, alternating left and right.
3. Two vertical lines with small curves at the top, one curving left and one curving right.
4. A zigzag line with 8 sharp angles, alternating left and right. The bottom is flat.
5. Two non-parallel lines, one vertical and one slanted, meeting at a point to form a wide angle.
6. A curved line resembling a spiral or corkscrew shape.

Right group:
1. A long horizontal rectangle.
2. A wavy line with 3 rounded peaks and valleys.
3. A single closed oval shape.
4. A long horizontal bar with short vertical lines extending down from each end.
5. A sequence of vertical bars of equal height with small gaps between them.
6. A thick horizontal line with a gap in the middle.

<thinking>
The left group contains open, angular, and curving lines. The right group contains mostly closed shapes, straight lines, and horizontal orientations.

The key difference seems to be that the left group are all made of a single continuous line, while the right group contains disconnected line segments or closed shapes made of multiple line segments.

<answer>
The images in the left group are all composed of a single, unbroken line. This line may be straight, angled, or curved, but there are no gaps or disconnected parts in any of the left images.

In contrast, the images in the right group are made up of multiple disconnected line segments, or closed shapes composed of several line segments. None of the right images contain a single continuous line.
