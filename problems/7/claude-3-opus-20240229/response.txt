Left group:
1. A single vertical line with a small oval or circle on the top and bottom.
2. Three vertical lines of varying lengths, with the longest in the middle.
3. A single vertical squiggly or wavy line.
4. Five evenly spaced short horizontal lines stacked vertically.
5. A single vertical line with an arrow pointing left on top.
6. A single vertical squiggly or wavy line that changes direction more frequently than image 3.

Right group:
1. A rectangle with a smaller vertical rectangle protruding from the top center.
2. Three curved lines next to each other that resemble waves or a simple drawing of the ocean.
3. A horizontal oval or pill shape.
4. A vertical rectangle with 5 small rectangles or teeth protruding from the left side at regular intervals.
5. A complex curved line that resembles a cursive word or letters.
6. Two parallel vertical lines with empty space between them.

<thinking>
The left group contains mostly simple straight or wavy vertical lines, with a few variations like arrows, circles, or horizontal lines. The right group has more complex shapes that resemble objects or symbols, like rectangles, ovals, ocean waves, or writing.

The key difference seems to be that the left group is made up of lines or simple combinations of lines, while the right group contains recognizable shapes, symbols, or objects made from lines.
