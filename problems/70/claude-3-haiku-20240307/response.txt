Analyzing the 12 images in detail:

Left group:
1. This image shows a branching, angular shape with several protrusions extending out from a central point.
2. This image depicts a more symmetrical, "V"-shaped structure with two main branches extending out from a central point.
3. This image shows a more complex, branching structure with multiple, uneven segments radiating out from a central point.
4. This image displays a branching shape with a curved, sweeping upper section and more angular, spiky lower sections.
5. This image presents a branching structure with a curved, looping main branch and several smaller, more angular branches extending out from it.
6. This image shows a branching structure with a curved, sinuous main branch and several shorter, more jagged secondary branches.

Right group:
1. This image depicts a more symmetrical, "Y"-shaped structure with two main branches extending out from a central point.
2. This image shows a branching structure with a curved, sinuous main branch and several shorter, more angular secondary branches.
3. This image presents a more complex, asymmetrical branching structure with multiple, uneven segments radiating out from a central point.
4. This image displays a branching shape with a curved, sweeping upper section and more angular, spiky lower sections.
5. This image shows a branching structure with a curved, looping main branch and several shorter, more angular secondary branches.
6. This image depicts a branching, angular shape with several protrusions extending out from a central point.

The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is the overall shape and structure of the branching patterns. The images in the left group generally have more angular, jagged branching patterns, while the images in the right group have more curved, sinuous branching patterns. Additionally, the images in the left group tend to have a more complex, asymmetrical structure, with multiple, uneven segments radiating out from a central point, while the images in the right group have a more symmetrical, "Y" or "V"-shaped structure.
