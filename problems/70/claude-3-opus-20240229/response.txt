Left group:
1. A branching structure with 3 branches emanating from a single point. The topmost branch is the shortest, while the bottom two branches are longer and split into two sub-branches each.
2. A branching structure with 4 branches, but only 3 endpoints. The two middle branches merge into one before terminating. The topmost and bottommost branches are single, direct paths.
3. A branching structure with 6 endpoints. The pattern follows a symmetrical path, splitting into two main branches which then split again into two sub-branches each.
4. An asymmetrical branching structure with 3 endpoints. The main branch angles upward and splits into two sub-branches. A single independent branch emerges from near the base and angles downward.
5. A symmetrical branching structure with 4 endpoints. The main trunk splits evenly into two branches which then terminate without further splitting.
6. An asymmetrical branching structure with 5 endpoints. The main branch curves and splits into two sub-branches heading left. On the right side, two independent branches emerge from the main trunk and angle towards the right.

Right group:
1. A branching structure with 5 endpoints arranged symmetrically. The main trunk splits into two branches which then split again, with the addition of a central sub-branch extending straight up.
2. A branching structure with 7 endpoints in a symmetrical arrangement. The pattern splits into two main branches, then splits into two sub-branches each, with a central sub-branch extending vertically from each main branch.
3. An asymmetrical branching structure with 4 endpoints. The main branch angles up and right before splitting into two sub-branches. A single independent branch emerges from the left side of the main trunk and angles down and left.
4. A branching structure with 6 endpoints. The main trunk splits into two central branches that terminate without splitting. Two pairs of outer independent branches emerge from the main trunk, angling left and right respectively.
5. A dense, symmetrical branching structure with 8 endpoints. The main trunk splits into two branches which then split into three sub-branches each - a central sub-branch flanked by two angled peripheral sub-branches.
6. A symmetrical branching structure with 6 endpoints. The main trunk splits evenly into two long branches which curve outwards before angling back inwards and terminating. No sub-branches are present.

<thinking>
The key difference between the left and right groups seems to be the presence or absence of branching points along the middle sections of the main branches:

- In the left group, the main branches always split at their endpoints into sub-branches, if they split at all. There are no branching points along the middle sections of the main branches.

- In the right group, most of the images exhibit branching points along the middle sections of the main branches. The main branches split into sub-branches at these intermediate points in addition to sometimes splitting at their endpoints.

The only exceptions to this pattern are images 3 and 6 in the right group, which have no mid-branch splitting, similar to the left group. But the overall dominant pattern in the right group is the presence of these intermediate branching points.

<answer>
The images in the left group have branching structures where the main branches only split into sub-branches at their endpoints, if at all. There are no branching points along the middle sections of the main branches.

In contrast, the images in the right group tend to feature branching points along the middle sections of the main branches. The main branches split into sub-branches at these intermediate points in addition to sometimes splitting at their endpoints.
