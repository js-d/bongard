Okay, let's take a close look at all 12 images and describe them in detail:

Left group:
1. This image shows a triangle with a circle inside it.
2. This image shows two circles, one larger than the other.
3. This image shows a triangle with a square inside it.
4. This image shows a circle with a triangle inside it.
5. This image shows a triangle with a circle and a square inside it.
6. This image shows a square with a triangle inside it.

Right group:
1. This image shows a triangle with a smaller triangle inside it.
2. This image shows three shapes - a triangle, a square, and a circle.
3. This image shows a circle with a triangle inside it.
4. This image shows a square with a circle inside it.
5. This image shows a triangle, a square, and a circle, all separate.
6. This image shows a triangle with a square inside it.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group all have at least one shape nested or contained within another shape, while the images in the right group do not have any nested shapes. The shapes in the right group are either separate or touching, but not contained within each other.
