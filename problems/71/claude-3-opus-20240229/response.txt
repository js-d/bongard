Left group:
1. A triangular shape containing a circle in the bottom left corner, with a square to the right of the triangle.
2. A square with a circle inside it.
3. A square with a small circle outside the top right corner.
4. A circular shape containing a square and triangle.
5. A triangular shape with squares at the top left and bottom right vertices.
6. A large circular shape containing a smaller circle and square.

Right group:
1. A triangular shape with squares along the right edge and a circle in the top left corner.
2. A square with circles inside and outside the square, and a triangle below.
3. A circular shape with geometric shapes arranged in a circular pattern inside - a triangle at the top, square at the right, and circle at the bottom left.
4. A large circle containing a smaller circle, with squares to the top right and bottom left of the large circle.
5. A triangular shape at the top with a square below, and circles to the left and right of the triangle.
6. A triangular shape with a square inside it.

<thinking>
The left group images all contain the geometric shapes with the square to the right of the main shape (triangle or circle).
The right group images have the square positioned differently - either inside, above, or to the left of the main shape. The circle also takes different positions in the right group.
So the key difference seems to be the relative positioning of the square and circle shapes compared to the main shape in each image.

<answer>
In the left group images, the square is always positioned to the right of the main shape (either a triangle or circle), while the circle takes other positions like inside or outside the main shape.
In the right group images, the square is positioned differently relative to the main shape - it can be inside, above, or to the left of the triangle or circle. The circle also takes on varying positions in the right group images.
The key differentiating factor between the two groups is the placement of the square and circle shapes in relation to the core triangle or circular shape in each image.
