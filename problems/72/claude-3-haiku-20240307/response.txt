Left group:
1. A wavy, curving shape with a gradual bend.
2. A shape resembling the letter 'm' with a rounded top and bottom.
3. A round, oval-like shape with a small indent at the top.
4. A 'U'-shaped curve with sharply pointed ends.
5. A shape with a distinct 'W'-like form.
6. An irregular, free-flowing squiggle shape.

Right group:
1. A sharp, jagged shape with multiple acute angles.
2. A more angular 'm'-like shape with pointed tips.
3. A rounded oval shape with a more pronounced indentation at the top.
4. A 'U'-shaped curve with rounded, less pointed ends.
5. A shape with a more distinct, less curvy 'W' form.
6. A tighter, more compact squiggle shape.

The key difference between the left and right groups is the overall shape and curvature of the images. The left group consists of more flowing, organic shapes with gradual curves and bends, while the right group has more angular, sharper shapes with distinct points and corners.

For example, in the left group, the 'm'-like shape (image 2) has a rounded, smooth top and bottom, whereas the corresponding shape in the right group (image 2) has more pointed, angular tips. The 'U'-shaped curve in the left group (image 4) has very sharp, pointed ends, while the right group version (image 4) has more rounded, less defined ends.

The squiggle shapes also differ, with the left group version (image 6) being more free-flowing and irregular, while the right group version (image 6) is tighter and more compact.

Overall, the left group appears to be more fluid and organic in its shapes, while the right group is more angular and geometric in its forms.
