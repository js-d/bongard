Left group:
1. This image contains a simple oval shape and a small triangle.
2. This image contains an oval shape and a rectangle.
3. This image contains a large oval shape and a smaller triangle.
4. This image contains an oval shape, a triangle, and a rectangle.
5. This image contains an oval shape and multiple smaller shapes, including a triangle and a rectangle.
6. This image contains an oval shape and multiple smaller shapes, including a triangle and a rectangle.

Right group:
1. This image contains an oval shape and a triangle, but the shapes have a more irregular, hand-drawn appearance compared to the left group.
2. This image contains an oval shape and a rectangle, but the shapes have a more irregular, hand-drawn appearance compared to the left group.
3. This image contains an oval shape and multiple smaller shapes, including a triangle and a rectangle, but the shapes have a more irregular, hand-drawn appearance compared to the left group.
4. This image contains an oval shape and multiple smaller shapes, including a triangle and a rectangle, but the shapes have a more irregular, hand-drawn appearance compared to the left group.
5. This image contains an oval shape and multiple smaller shapes, including a triangle and a rectangle, but the shapes have a more irregular, hand-drawn appearance compared to the left group.
6. This image contains an oval shape and multiple smaller shapes, including a triangle and a rectangle, but the shapes have a more irregular, hand-drawn appearance compared to the left group.

<thinking>
The main difference between the left group and the right group is the appearance of the shapes. The shapes in the left group are more geometric and uniform, while the shapes in the right group have a more irregular, hand-drawn appearance. This suggests that the left group and the right group may represent different categories or concepts, and the task is to determine what those categories or concepts are.

<answer>
The left group appears to contain more geometric and uniform shapes, while the right group contains shapes with a more irregular, hand-drawn appearance. This suggests that the left group may represent a set of objects or concepts that are more precise and well-defined, while the right group may represent a set of objects or concepts that are more abstract or subjective. The task is to determine the underlying rule or pattern that separates these two groups.
