Left group:
1. A rectangular shape and a triangular shape.
2. Three triangular shapes of varying sizes and orientations.
3. An oval shape, a triangular shape pointing right, and a rectangular shape.
4. An oval shape and a triangular shape pointing left.
5. A rectangular shape and three oval shapes of varying sizes.
6. Four triangular shapes of varying sizes and orientations.

Right group:
1. An oval shape, a triangular shape pointing right, a rectangular shape, and another triangular shape pointing right.
2. Five triangular shapes of varying sizes and orientations.
3. Four oval shapes of varying sizes and orientations.
4. A triangular shape pointing right, an oval shape, and a rectangular shape.
5. A rectangular shape, an oval shape, and a triangular shape pointing right.
6. An oval shape, two triangular shapes pointing left, and a rectangular shape.

The key difference I notice between the left and right groups is the number of shapes in each image. The left group images contain 2-4 distinct shapes each, while the right group images contain 3-5 distinct shapes each. The right group consistently has more shapes per image than the left group.

Another potential difference is the right group seems to more frequently combine ovals, triangles and rectangles together in the same image, while the left group images tend to focus on just one or two shape types, like only ovals and triangles or only rectangles and ovals. The right group mixes the shape types together more.

But the number of shapes per image stands out as the clearest and most consistent differentiator between the two groups based on analyzing the images in detail.

The key difference between the images in the left group and right group is that the right group images each contain a greater number of distinct shapes than the left group images. The left group images have 2-4 shapes each, while the right group images have 3-5 shapes each. So the right group consistently depicts more shapes per image compared to the left group.
