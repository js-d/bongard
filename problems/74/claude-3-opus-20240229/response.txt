Left group:
1. A single leaf-like shape.
2. A single oval-like shape.
3. Two connected oval-like shapes, forming a curved path.
4. Two connected oval-like shapes, forming a curved path with the second oval larger than the first.
5. Two distinct shapes - a leaf-like shape and a semi-circular shape.
6. A single leaf-like shape.

Right group:
1. A curved path formed by two connected oval-like shapes.
2. A noose-like shape formed by a curved path with a loop at one end.
3. A single curved shape like a tadpole or sperm.
4. A paisley-like shape formed by a large oval with a curved tail.
5. A curved path formed by two connected ovals, with the path crossing over itself.
6. A closed loop formed by a curved path crossing over itself.

<thinking>
The key difference seems to be that the shapes in the left group are open paths or distinct separate shapes, while the shapes in the right group contain closed loops or paths that cross over themselves.

The left group shapes are simpler, with only open curves, leaves, and ovals. None of the paths intersect or cross over themselves.

In contrast, the right group shapes all feature some kind of closed loop or self-intersection, whether it's a path crossing over itself, a closed loop at the end, or a path curving around to intersect itself. The paths are more complex and tangled.

<answer>
The shapes in the left group are all open paths or distinct separate shapes, while the shapes in the right group all contain closed loops or paths that cross over or intersect with themselves in some way to create a closed loop or self-intersecting, more tangled shape.
