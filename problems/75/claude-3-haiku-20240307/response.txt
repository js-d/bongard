Analyzing the images in the 'left' group:

Left group:
1. The image consists of a curved line and a triangle.
2. The image consists of a curved line and a triangle.
3. The image consists of a curved line and a triangle.
4. The image consists of a curved line and a triangle.
5. The image consists of a curved line and a triangle.
6. The image consists of a curved line and a triangle.

Analyzing the images in the 'right' group:
Right group:
1. The image consists of a curved line and an inverted triangle.
2. The image consists of a curved line and a triangle.
3. The image consists of a curved line and an inverted triangle.
4. The image consists of a curved line and an inverted triangle.
5. The image consists of a curved line and an inverted triangle.
6. The image consists of a curved line and a triangle.

Comparing the two groups:
The main difference between the images in the 'left' group and the 'right' group is the orientation of the triangle. In the 'left' group, the triangle is upright, while in the 'right' group, the triangle is inverted in some of the images.
