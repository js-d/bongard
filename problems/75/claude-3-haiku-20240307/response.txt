Let me carefully analyze and describe each of the 12 images in detail.

Left group:
1. The image contains a curved, wavy shape with a triangular shape below it.
2. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
3. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
4. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
5. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
6. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.

Right group:
1. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
2. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
3. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
4. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
5. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.
6. The image contains a curved, wavy shape and a triangular shape.

The key difference between the images in the left group and the right group is that the triangular shape in the left group is always positioned below the curved, wavy shape, while the triangular shape in the right group is always positioned next to the curved, wavy shape.
