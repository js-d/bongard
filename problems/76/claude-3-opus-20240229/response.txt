Left group:
1. A pixelated outline of an irregular shape with a protrusion on the left side.
2. A pixelated outline of a vase-like shape with a narrow neck and wider base.
3. A pixelated outline of a bone-shaped object with rounded ends.
4. A pixelated outline of a bone-like shape with one thick end and one tapered end.
5. A pixelated outline of an hourglass-like shape with a narrow center and wider top and bottom.
6. A pixelated outline of a thin, elongated shape that curves and tapers to a point on one end.

Right group:
1. A pixelated outline of an irregular rounded shape with a hole or gap in the center.
2. A pixelated outline of a roughly circular or oval shape with jagged, pixelated edges.
3. A pixelated outline of a capsule-like shape that is elongated with rounded ends.
4. A pixelated outline of an irregular, roughly rectangular shape with jagged, pixelated edges.
5. A pixelated outline of an irregular, polygonal shape with straight edges and pointed corners.
6. A pixelated outline of an irregular, roughly oval shape with a pixelated, uneven outline.

The left group contains shapes that are generally contiguous, meaning they are formed from a single connected outline without gaps or holes. The shapes in the left group also tend to have smoother, more organic outlines with curves and rounded forms.

In contrast, the right group contains shapes with gaps, holes or disconnected parts in their outlines. The shapes in the right group also have more jagged, irregular edges formed by the square pixels, giving them a more polygonal, geometric appearance compared to the smoother shapes in the left group.

<answer>
The key difference between the left and right groups is that the shapes in the left group are contiguous, meaning they are formed from a single connected outline, while the shapes in the right group contain gaps, holes or disconnected parts in their outlines. Additionally, the left group tends to have smoother, more organic shapes, while the right group has more jagged, pixelated outlines giving the shapes a more geometric appearance.
