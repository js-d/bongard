Okay, let's analyze the images step-by-step:

Left group:
1. The image shows a black line in the shape of an upside-down 'V' or a downward-pointing arrow.
2. The image shows a black line in the shape of an 'L' or right angle.
3. The image shows two black lines, one longer and one shorter, intersecting at an angle.
4. The image shows three black lines radiating out from a central point, forming a star or asterisk shape.
5. The image shows a black line in the shape of a backwards 'L' or left angle.
6. The image shows a black line in the shape of an upward-pointing arrow.

Right group:
1. The image shows a black line in the shape of an 'L' or right angle.
2. The image shows a black line in the shape of a backwards 'L' or left angle.
3. The image shows a black line in the shape of an upward-pointing arrow.
4. The image shows a black line in the shape of a downward-pointing arrow.
5. The image shows two black lines, one longer and one shorter, intersecting at an angle.
6. The image shows a black line in the shape of an upside-down 'V' or a downward-pointing arrow.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is the orientation and directionality of the lines and shapes. The left group predominantly features downward-pointing shapes, while the right group predominantly features upward-pointing shapes. This suggests that the 'left' group and 'right' group are differentiated by the overall direction or orientation of the lines and shapes within the images.
