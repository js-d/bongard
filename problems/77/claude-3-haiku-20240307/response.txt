To analyze the 12 images and find the difference between the left and right groups, I will examine each image in detail and compare the patterns and structures within the groups.

Left group:
1. The image shows a tall, narrow shape with a V-shaped profile, tapering towards the bottom.
2. This image depicts a similar tall, narrow shape, but with a more pronounced V-shape and a slightly wider base.
3. The shape in this image is more angular, with a sharper V-shape and a narrower base compared to the previous two.
4. This image shows a tall, narrow shape with a more gradual V-shape and a wider base.
5. The shape in this image is more triangular, with a wider base and a more gradual slope towards the top.
6. This image displays a tall, narrow shape with a distinct, sharp V-shape and a relatively narrow base.

Right group:
1. The image shows a shape that starts narrow at the top and gradually widens towards the bottom, forming a more curved, exponential-like profile.
2. This image depicts a shape that is similar to the first, but with a more pronounced curve and a slightly wider base.
3. The shape in this image is more angular, with a series of stepped segments creating a more jagged appearance.
4. This image shows a shape that is more triangular, with a wider base and a more gradual slope towards the top.
5. The shape in this image is more irregular, with a series of angular segments and a more asymmetrical profile.
6. This image displays a shape that starts narrow at the top and gradually widens towards the bottom, forming a distinct, curved profile.

<answer>
The key difference between the left group and the right group is the overall shape and profile of the images. The images in the left group all feature tall, narrow shapes with V-shaped or triangular profiles, tapering towards the bottom. In contrast, the images in the right group display shapes that start narrow at the top and gradually widen towards the bottom, forming more curved or exponential-like profiles.

Within each group, the images vary in the specific details of the shape, such as the sharpness of the V-shape, the width of the base, and the overall symmetry of the profile. However, the fundamental distinction between the left group (V-shaped or triangular profiles) and the right group (curved or exponential-like profiles) is the consistent pattern that differentiates the two sets of images.
