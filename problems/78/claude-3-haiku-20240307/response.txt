Okay, let's analyze these images in detail.

Left group:
1. This image contains two vertical lines of different lengths - one longer and one shorter.
2. This image contains a single vertical line.
3. This image contains two vertical lines of different lengths - one longer and one shorter.
4. This image contains a single vertical line.
5. This image contains two vertical lines of the same length.
6. This image contains a single vertical line.

Right group:
1. This image contains a single vertical line and a single horizontal line that intersect.
2. This image contains two vertical lines of the same length, with a single horizontal line between them.
3. This image contains a single vertical line and a single horizontal line that intersect.
4. This image contains two vertical lines of different lengths, with a single horizontal line between them.
5. This image contains a single vertical line and a single horizontal line that intersect.
6. This image contains a single vertical line and a single horizontal line that intersect.

Now, let's think about the difference between the left and right groups. In the left group, all the images contain only vertical lines, either single lines or pairs of lines. In the right group, all the images contain a combination of vertical and horizontal lines, either intersecting or with a horizontal line between the vertical lines.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is the presence or absence of horizontal lines.

The images in the left group all contain only vertical lines, either single lines or pairs of lines of different lengths. In contrast, the images in the right group all contain a combination of vertical and horizontal lines, with the horizontal lines either intersecting the vertical lines or positioned between the vertical lines.
