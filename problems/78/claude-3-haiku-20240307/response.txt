Let's analyze the images in the left and right groups, and then identify the key differences between them.

Left group:
1. A single, straight black line.
2. A jagged, diagonal black line.
3. A straight black line with a smaller diagonal line branching off from it.
4. A diagonal black line with a smaller diagonal line branching off from it.
5. A diagonal black line with multiple smaller diagonal lines branching off from it.
6. A diagonal black line with a curved, jagged pattern at the bottom.

Right group:
1. A straight black line with multiple smaller diagonal lines branching off from it.
2. A straight black line with a single diagonal line branching off from it.
3. A straight black line with a smaller, diagonal line branching off from it.
4. A diagonal black line with a smaller, diagonal line branching off from it.
5. A diagonal black line with a curved, jagged pattern at the bottom.
6. A diagonal black line with multiple smaller diagonal lines branching off from it, forming a more complex pattern.

The key difference between the left and right groups is the complexity of the patterns. The images in the left group have relatively simple, straightforward patterns, while the images in the right group have more complex, branching patterns.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is the complexity of the patterns. The images in the left group have relatively simple, straightforward patterns, such as single straight or diagonal lines, while the images in the right group have more complex, branching patterns with multiple smaller lines extending from the main line.
