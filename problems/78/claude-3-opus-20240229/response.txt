Left group:
1. A vertical line with a short diagonal line extending downward to the right.
2. A short horizontal line with a vertical line extending downward.
3. A long horizontal line with two short vertical lines, one on each end, both extending downward.
4. Two diagonal lines, one longer extending from top left to bottom right, and a shorter one branching down and right from the middle of the first line.
5. Two parallel vertical lines, the one on the right slightly longer, with a horizontal line underneath connecting them.
6. A long diagonal line from top left to bottom right with a shorter vertical line branching downward from near the right end.

Right group:
1. A long horizontal line with a short vertical line on the left end extending downward and a short diagonal line on the right end extending upward to the right.
2. A long horizontal line with two short lines branching upward, one vertical on the left end and one diagonal on the right end.
3. A short vertical line with a longer diagonal line extending from the bottom of the vertical line down and to the right.
4. A short vertical line with a longer horizontal line extending to the right from the bottom of the vertical line.
5. A long horizontal line with a single short vertical line extending downward from the left end.
6. A short diagonal line extending from top left to bottom right with a vertical line of the same length extending downward from the right end of the diagonal line.

<thinking>
The key differences I notice between the left and right groups are:
- In the left group, most lines extend downward, while in the right group there are more lines extending upward or horizontally to the right.
- The left group has more diagonal lines going from top left to bottom right, while the right group has more horizontal lines.
- The right group has more short vertical lines with longer lines branching off at 90 degree or acute angles. The left group's lines branch more often at obtuse angles or have parallel vertical lines.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is the orientation and angles of the lines. The images in the left group predominantly contain lines extending downward, often diagonally from top left to bottom right. The right group's images feature more lines extending either horizontally to the right or upward, and tend to have short vertical lines with longer lines branching off at 90 degree or acute angles.
