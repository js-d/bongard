To analyze the images, I will describe each one in detail, focusing on the shapes and their arrangement within the images.

Left group:
1. The image contains a black circle and a black triangle.
2. The image contains a black circle and a black triangle.
3. The image contains a single black circle.
4. The image contains a black circle and a black triangle.
5. The image contains a single black circle.
6. The image contains a black circle and a black triangle.

Right group:
1. The image contains a black triangle and a black circle.
2. The image contains a black triangle and a black circle.
3. The image contains a single black circle.
4. The image contains a black triangle and a black circle.
5. The image contains a single black circle.
6. The image contains a black triangle and a black circle.

Based on the descriptions, the key difference between the left group and the right group seems to be the relative positioning of the shapes. In the left group, the circle and triangle are always arranged with the circle on the left and the triangle on the right. In the right group, the circle and triangle are always arranged with the triangle on the left and the circle on the right.
