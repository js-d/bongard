To solve this Bongard problem, I will carefully examine and describe each of the 12 images, paying close attention to the shapes, positions, and relationships between the elements in each image. I will then look for the key difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group.

Left group:
1. This image contains a large black circle, a small black triangle, and a small white circle.
2. This image contains a small black triangle and a small white circle.
3. This image contains a small black circle and a small white triangle.
4. This image contains a small black circle, a small white triangle, and a small white circle.
5. This image contains a small black circle and a small white circle.
6. This image contains a small black triangle and a small white circle.

Right group:
1. This image contains a small black triangle and a small white circle.
2. This image contains a small black circle and a small white triangle.
3. This image contains a small black triangle and a small white circle.
4. This image contains a small black circle and a small white circle.
5. This image contains a small black circle.
6. This image contains a small black triangle and a small white circle.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the left group contains a combination of at least two shapes (a circle and a triangle), while the right group contains either a single shape or a combination of a circle and a triangle.

The difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group is that the 'left' group contains images with a combination of at least two shapes (a circle and a triangle), while the 'right' group contains images with either a single shape or a combination of a circle and a triangle.
