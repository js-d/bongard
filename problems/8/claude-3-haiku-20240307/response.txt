To describe the images, I will analyze each one in detail, noting the shape, size, and arrangement of the black and white pixels.

Left group:
1. This image contains a single black triangular shape pointing upwards, centered in the frame.
2. This image contains a single black rectangular shape, centered in the frame.
3. This image contains a single black curved shape, resembling a crescent or a fishhook, centered in the frame.
4. This image contains a single black circular shape, centered in the frame.
5. This image contains a single black shape that is a combination of a triangle and a curved line, centered in the frame.
6. This image contains a single black shape that is a combination of a triangle and a curved line, centered in the frame, but the shape is mirrored compared to the previous image.

Right group:
1. This image contains a single black rectangular shape, positioned to the left side of the frame.
2. This image is entirely white, with no black shapes.
3. This image contains a single black triangular shape pointing downwards, centered in the frame.
4. This image contains a single black shape that is a combination of a triangle and a curved line, centered in the frame.
5. This image contains a single black shape that is a combination of a triangle and a curved line, centered in the frame, but the shape is mirrored compared to the previous image.
6. This image contains a single black shape that is a combination of a triangle and a curved line, centered in the frame, but the shape is more angular compared to the previous images.

Analyzing the differences between the left and right groups, the key distinction is that the images in the left group all contain a single, centered, geometric shape, while the images in the right group either have a single off-center shape or a more complex, asymmetric shape.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is the structure and positioning of the shapes within the frames.

The images in the left group all contain a single, centered, geometric shape, such as a triangle, rectangle, or curved line. These shapes are simple and symmetrical.

In contrast, the images in the right group either have a single off-center shape or a more complex, asymmetric shape. The shapes are not as simple or centered as the ones in the left group.
