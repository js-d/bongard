Left group:
1. A black equilateral triangle pointing upwards on a white background.
2. A black rectangle with a smaller white rectangle cut out of the right side on a white background.
3. A black irregular hexagon shape that resembles a leaf or spearhead pointing to the right on a white background.
4. A black circle with a smaller circle cut out of the right side on a white background.
5. A black irregular shape resembling Australia or a splatter pointing to the upper right on a white background.
6. A black diamond or rhombus shape on a white background.

Right group:
1. A black rectangle with a smaller white rectangle cut out of the left side on a white background.
2. A black irregular shape resembling Australia or a splatter pointing to the upper left on a white background.
3. A black rectangle with a smaller white square cut out of the center on a white background.
4. A black irregular kidney bean shape pointing to the left on a white background.
5. A black irregular kidney bean shape pointing to the right on a white background.
6. A black hourglass shape on a white background.

<thinking>
The key differences I notice between the left and right groups are:
- The left group contains more enclosed shapes with cutouts, while the right has more open, irregular shapes
- The directionality of shapes in the left group tends to point right or up, while shapes in the right group point left, or have no clear directionality
- The left group has a triangle and rhombus, while the right group has an hourglass shape, showing differences in the core geometric shapes

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that shapes in the left group have portions cut out or removed from them, resulting in incomplete, enclosed shapes. The right group contains shapes that are fully intact and complete, even if irregular. Additionally, shapes in the left group tend to have a rightward or upward orientation, while shapes on the right either point left or have a neutral directionality.
