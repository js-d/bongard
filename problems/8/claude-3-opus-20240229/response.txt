Left group:
1. An equilateral triangle with all sides of equal length and angles of 60 degrees each.
2. A rectangle with two longer parallel sides and two shorter parallel sides meeting at 90 degree angles.
3. An ellipse with a continuously curving closed path, symmetrical about both its major and minor axes.
4. A circle with all points equidistant from the center on a plane, forming a perfectly round closed curve.
5. Two straight line segments connected end-to-end at a shared endpoint, forming a 'V' like shape with an acute angle between the segments.
6. A regular hexagon with six equal length sides and six 120 degree internal angles.

Right group:
1. A rectangle standing vertically with two shorter horizontal sides and two longer vertical sides, all meeting at 90 degree angles.
2. An upside-down equilateral triangle pointing downwards, with equal length sides and 60 degree angles.
3. A square oriented diagonally, with four equal length sides meeting at 90 degree right angles, with corners pointing up/down and left/right.
4. A parenthesis-like curved line, thicker at the top and bottom endpoints and thinner in the middle, not a closed shape.
5. A circle with a diagonal line segment running from the top left to the bottom right, dividing it into two equal sections.
6. An hourglass-like shape formed by two triangles connected at their points, one pointing up and one inverted pointing down, forming an 'X' shape.

<thinking>
The left group contains closed geometric shapes like triangles, rectangles, ellipses, circles and hexagons. The right group has some similar shapes but oriented differently, as well as some non-closed shapes and shapes with interior lines dividing them.
The key difference seems to be that all shapes in the left group are closed shapes with no gaps, holes or dividing lines. The right group shapes are either open, inverted/rotated versions of the left shapes, or have lines dividing their interior.

<answer>
The shapes in the left group are all closed shapes with continuous perimeters and no gaps, holes or dividing lines in their interior.
The shapes in the right group are either open shapes with gaps, inverted/rotated versions of the closed shapes from the left group, or closed shapes that have a line or gap dividing them into multiple sections.
