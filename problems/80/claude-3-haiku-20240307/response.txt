To analyze the 12 images, I will first describe each one in detail, then compare the left and right groups to identify the key differences.

Left group:
1. A single black square in the center of the image.
2. Two black squares, one on the left and one on the right, with a cross-shaped symbol in the center.
3. A cross-shaped symbol in the center of the image, with a single black square below it.
4. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square above it and another below it.
5. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square to the left and another to the right.
6. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square above it.

Right group:
1. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square to the right and another below it.
2. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square below it.
3. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square to the right.
4. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square to the left and another below it.
5. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square above it and another to the right.
6. A cross-shaped symbol in the center, with a single black square to the left and another to the right.

The key difference between the left and right groups is the position of the single black squares in relation to the cross-shaped symbol. In the left group, the single black squares are always either above, below, or to the sides of the cross-shaped symbol. In the right group, the single black squares are positioned in various locations around the cross-shaped symbol, but not always in the same positions as in the left group.

<answer>
The key difference between the 'left' and 'right' groups of images is the positioning of the single black squares in relation to the cross-shaped symbol in the center of each image.

In the 'left' group:
- The single black squares are always either above, below, or to the sides of the cross-shaped symbol.

In the 'right' group:
- The single black squares are positioned in various locations around the cross-shaped symbol, but not always in the same positions as in the 'left' group.
