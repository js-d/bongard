Okay, let me carefully analyze each of the 12 images and describe them in detail.

Left group:
1. This image contains a black circle and a black plus sign in the center.
2. This image contains a black circle and a black plus sign in the center, similar to the previous image.
3. This image contains a black circle and a black plus sign in the center, again similar to the previous two images.
4. This image contains a black circle and a black plus sign in the center, following the pattern of the previous images.
5. This image contains a black circle and a black plus sign in the center, continuing the pattern.
6. This image contains a black circle and a black plus sign in the center, completing the set of six images in the left group.

Right group:
1. This image contains a black circle and a black X shape in the center.
2. This image contains a black circle and a black X shape in the center, similar to the previous image.
3. This image contains a black circle and a black X shape in the center, following the pattern of the previous two images.
4. This image contains a black circle and a black X shape in the center, continuing the pattern.
5. This image contains a black circle and a black X shape in the center, maintaining the pattern.
6. This image contains a black circle and a black X shape in the center, completing the set of six images in the right group.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is the shape in the center of the images. The left group all have a plus sign in the center, while the right group all have an X shape in the center.
