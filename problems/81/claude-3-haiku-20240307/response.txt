Okay, let's analyze the images carefully:

Left group:
1. This image contains a circle, a triangle, and an oval shape.
2. This image contains a circle, a triangle, and an oval shape.
3. This image contains a circle and three triangles.
4. This image contains a circle and three triangles.
5. This image contains three triangles and three circles.
6. This image contains three triangles and three circles.

Right group:
1. This image contains a circle, a triangle, and an oval shape.
2. This image contains a circle, a triangle, and an oval shape.
3. This image contains a circle, a triangle, and an oval shape.
4. This image contains a circle and three triangles.
5. This image contains three triangles and three circles.
6. This image contains three triangles and three circles.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group have the shapes arranged in a more organized and symmetrical pattern, while the images in the right group have the shapes arranged in a more random and asymmetrical pattern.

<answer>
The left group of images all have a clear, organized, and symmetrical arrangement of the shapes, with the shapes positioned in a consistent and predictable manner. In contrast, the right group of images have a more random and asymmetrical arrangement of the shapes, with the shapes positioned in a less consistent and predictable manner.
