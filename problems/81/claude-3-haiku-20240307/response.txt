Let me carefully analyze the 12 images provided and describe each one in the left and right groups, and then explain the difference between the two groups.

Left group:
1. The image contains 5 shapes: a circle, a triangle, a circle, a triangle, and a square.
2. The image contains 5 shapes: 3 circles, a triangle, and a triangle.
3. The image contains 3 shapes: 2 circles and a triangle.
4. The image contains 5 shapes: 3 circles, a triangle, and a triangle.
5. The image contains 4 shapes: 2 triangles and 2 circles.
6. The image contains 5 shapes: 4 circles and a triangle.

Right group:
1. The image contains 5 shapes: 3 triangles and 2 circles.
2. The image contains 5 shapes: 2 triangles, 2 circles, and a square.
3. The image contains 5 shapes: 2 circles, 2 triangles, and a square.
4. The image contains 5 shapes: 3 circles and 2 triangles.
5. The image contains 5 shapes: 2 circles, 2 triangles, and a square.
6. The image contains 4 shapes: 2 triangles and 2 circles.

The key difference between the left and right groups is that the left group contains more circular shapes, while the right group contains more triangular shapes. The left group has a higher proportion of circles compared to the right group, which has a higher proportion of triangles.
