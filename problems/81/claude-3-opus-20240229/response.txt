Left group:
1. Six black geometrical shapes on white background: one circle, three triangles of different sizes and orientations, and two irregular shapes resembling rough circles.
2. Seven black geometrical shapes on white background: three circles of varying sizes, and four triangles of different sizes and orientations.
3. Five black geometrical shapes on white: one circle, three irregular shapes resembling rough circles, and one equilateral triangle pointing upwards.
4. Five black geometrical shapes on white: three circles of varying sizes forming a triangle shape, and two equilateral triangles of different sizes both pointing upwards.
5. Nine black geometrical shapes on white arranged in a triangular formation: one circle at top, two triangles below, three irregular circular shapes, and three more circles at bottom.
6. Seven black geometrical shapes on white: three circles of varying sizes, four irregular circular shapes of different sizes arranged haphazardly.

Right group:
1. Six black geometrical shapes on white: three circles and three triangles of varying sizes, arranged with triangles pointing towards circles.
2. Seven black geometrical shapes on white: one circle surrounded by six triangles of varying sizes, all pointing inwards towards the circle.
3. Seven black geometrical shapes on white background: two circles and five triangles of varying sizes, arranged haphazardly but with triangles pointing towards circles.
4. Seven black geometrical shapes on white: three circles and four triangles arranged with three triangles pointing towards circles, one triangle separate.
5. Seven black geometrical shapes on white: three circles and four triangles arranged in a roughly circular pattern, triangles pointing inwards.
6. Eight black geometrical shapes on white: four circles and four triangles alternating in a square formation, triangles pointing inwards.

<thinking>
The left images contain only circles, triangles, and irregular circular shapes in varying arrangements. The right images also have circles and triangles, but the triangles are consistently pointing towards or facing the circles in each image.

This seems to be the key difference - in the left group, the shapes are more randomly arranged without a clear relationship between the circles and triangles. But in the right group, the triangles are intentionally directed inward at the circles in each image, suggesting some connection or interaction between the shapes.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is the relationship between the shapes:

In the left group images, the circles, triangles and irregular circular shapes are arranged randomly without any consistent positioning or orientation relative to each other.

In the right group images, the triangular shapes are always pointing or facing towards the circular shapes in each image, suggesting some intentional connection or interaction between the triangles and circles. The triangles seem to be directed at or reacting to the presence of the circles.
