To analyze the 12 images and describe the differences between the left and right groups, I will go through each image in detail.

Left group:
1. This image shows a simple black plus sign (+) in the center of the frame.
2. This image shows two black plus signs (+) positioned side-by-side in the center of the frame.
3. This image shows three black plus signs (+) arranged in a triangular pattern in the center of the frame.
4. This image shows four black plus signs (+) arranged in a square pattern in the center of the frame.
5. This image shows a black circle (O) surrounded by several black plus signs (+) arranged randomly across the frame.
6. This image shows a single black plus sign (+) in the center of the frame.

Right group:
1. This image shows two black plus signs (+) positioned side-by-side in the center of the frame.
2. This image shows a single black plus sign (+) in the center of the frame, with a black circle (O) to the right of the plus sign.
3. This image shows several black plus signs (+) arranged randomly across the frame, with a single black circle (O) in the center.
4. This image shows a black circle (O) surrounded by several black plus signs (+) arranged randomly across the frame.
5. This image shows a single black plus sign (+) in the center of the frame, with a black circle (O) to the left of the plus sign.
6. This image shows several black plus signs (+) arranged randomly across the frame, with a single black circle (O) in the center.

The main difference between the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group contain only black plus signs (+), while the images in the right group contain a combination of black plus signs (+) and black circles (O).

In the left group, the images show an increasing number of plus signs, starting with a single plus sign and building up to multiple plus signs arranged in various patterns (e.g., side-by-side, triangular, square).

In the right group, the images show a mix of plus signs and circles, with the circles appearing either alone or in combination with the plus signs. The arrangement of the elements in the right group is more random and scattered compared to the more organized patterns in the left group.

So, the key difference between the two groups is the presence of the circle element in the right group, which is absent in the left group.
