Analyzing the images in the left group:

Left group:
1. This image contains 5 small plus signs (+) arranged in a square pattern, with one empty space in the center.
2. This image contains 4 small plus signs (+) arranged in a square pattern, with one empty space in the center.
3. This image contains 3 small plus signs (+) arranged in a square pattern, with one empty space in the center.
4. This image contains 1 small plus sign (+) in the center.
5. This image contains 6 small plus signs (+) arranged in a square pattern, with one empty space in the center.
6. This image contains 2 small plus signs (+) arranged horizontally, with one empty space in the center.

Analyzing the images in the right group:
Right group:
1. This image contains 1 small plus sign (+) and 1 small circle (o) arranged horizontally.
2. This image contains 3 small plus signs (+) arranged in a row, with 1 small circle (o) in the center.
3. This image contains 2 small plus signs (+) and 1 small circle (o) arranged in a row.
4. This image contains 4 small plus signs (+) arranged in a square pattern, with 1 small circle (o) in the center.
5. This image contains 4 small plus signs (+) and 1 small circle (o) arranged in a row.
6. This image contains 4 small plus signs (+) and 2 small circles (o) arranged in a grid pattern.

Thinking about the differences between the left and right groups:
The main difference between the left and right groups is the presence of circles (o) in the right group images, while the left group images only contain plus signs (+). The arrangement and number of the plus signs also differs between the two groups.
