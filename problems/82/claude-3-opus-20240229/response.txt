Left group:
1. Four black crosses of varying orientations on a white background. One cross is centered, one is in the bottom right, one is in the top left, and one is in the bottom left.
2. Five black crosses of varying orientations on a white background. A circle is in the center surrounded by crosses in the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right.
3. Five black crosses and one black circle on a white background. The circle is in the top right, with crosses in the center, top left, bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right.
4. Five black symbols on a white background - a circle in the center, crosses in the top left and bottom right, and crosses rotated 45 degrees in the bottom left and top right.
5. Four black symbols on a white background - crosses in the top right, bottom left, and bottom right, and a rotated cross in the top left.
6. Five black symbols on a white background - a cross in the top left, a circle in the bottom right, and rotated crosses in the center, top right and bottom left.

Right group:
1. Four black symbols on a white background - crosses in the top left, top right, and bottom right, and a circle in the bottom left.
2. Five black symbols on a white background - a cross in the top left, rotated crosses in the center, bottom left and bottom right, and a circle in the top right.
3. Five black symbols arranged in a cross pattern on a white background - a circle in the center, crosses in the top center and bottom center, and rotated crosses in the left center and right center.
4. Six black symbols symmetrically arranged on a white background - rotated crosses in the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right, and regular crosses in the left center and right center.
5. Seven black symbols on a white background - a circle in the top center, crosses in the left center, center, and right center, and rotated crosses in the top left, top right and bottom center.
6. Six black symbols on a white background - a cross in the top center, a circle in the center, rotated crosses flanking the circle on the left and right, and crosses in the bottom left and bottom right.

The key differences I notice between the left and right groups are:

1. In the left group, when a circle is present, there are always more crosses than circles (usually just one circle). In the right group, the circle seems more prominent, sometimes being the center of a symmetrical arrangement of crosses.

2. The crosses in the left group seem more randomly oriented and placed, while the right group tends to have more symmetrical, patterned arrangements of crosses around the circle when present. 

3. The right group images tend to have more symbols overall, with 5-7 symbols being common, while the left group usually has 4-5 symbols per image.

So in summary, the left group has fewer symbols, usually one or no circles, and more randomly placed crosses, while the right group has more symbols overall, more prominent circle placement, and crosses arranged more symmetrically around the circle.

<answer>
The images in the left group tend to have fewer symbols (usually 4-5), with crosses placed more randomly and only zero or one less prominent circles. The right group images have more symbols (5-7), with crosses arranged in more symmetrical patterns, often around a centrally placed circle that acts as a focal point.
