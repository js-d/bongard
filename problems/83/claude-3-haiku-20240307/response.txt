Left group:
1. This image contains 5 crosses arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with one circle in the center.
2. This image contains 4 crosses arranged in a square pattern, with one circle in the center.
3. This image contains 6 crosses arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with one circle in the center.
4. This image contains 3 crosses arranged in a triangular pattern, with one circle in the center.
5. This image contains 5 crosses arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with one circle in the center.
6. This image contains 4 crosses arranged in a square pattern, with one circle in the center.

Right group:
1. This image contains 4 crosses arranged in a square pattern, with one circle in the center.
2. This image contains 3 crosses arranged in a triangular pattern, with one circle in the center.
3. This image contains 5 crosses arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with one circle in the center.
4. This image contains 4 crosses arranged in a square pattern, with one circle in the center.
5. This image contains 3 crosses arranged in a triangular pattern, with one circle in the center.
6. This image contains 6 crosses arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with one circle in the center.

<thinking>
The key difference between the left group and the right group is the arrangement of the crosses. In the left group, the crosses are arranged in more complex, symmetrical patterns, while in the right group, the crosses are arranged in simpler, more geometric patterns like squares and triangles.

Additionally, the number of crosses in each image varies, with the left group having a wider range of cross counts (3, 4, 5, and 6) compared to the right group (3, 4, and 5).

So the primary distinction seems to be the complexity and symmetry of the cross arrangements, as well as the range of cross counts, between the two groups.
