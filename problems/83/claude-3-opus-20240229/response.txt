Left group:
1. Two crosses on left and right, and a circle in the center.
2. A cross on the left, a circle in the center, and three crosses on the right.
3. Four crosses surrounding a central circle in a square formation.
4. Three crosses and a circle arranged in a diamond shape, with the circle in the lower right position.
5. Four crosses arranged in a square with a central circle.
6. A cross on the left and right, with two circles arranged vertically in the center.

Right group:
1. A circle at the top, a cross on the left, two crosses on the right, and a cross at the bottom forming an asymmetrical arrangement.
2. A cross on the left, a circle in the center, a cross on the upper right and lower right forming a triangular arrangement.
3. A circle at the top, two crosses on the left and right, and a cross at the bottom forming a diamond arrangement.
4. A circle on the left, a cross above and below the circle, and two crosses on the right forming an irregular arrangement.
5. Three crosses and a circle arranged symmetrically, with the circle in the center of the bottom row.
6. A cross on the left, top, and bottom, with a circle and cross on the right forming an asymmetrical cross shape.

<thinking>
- The left group images have symmetrical arrangements of crosses and circles.
- The right group images have asymmetrical or irregular arrangements of crosses and circles.
- The left group tends to have the circle in the center or as part of a symmetrical pattern.
- The right group has the circle in various positions, often creating an imbalance or asymmetry in the overall arrangement.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is symmetry. The left group images feature crosses and circles arranged in symmetrical, balanced patterns, often with the circle in the center or as part of a symmetrical formation. In contrast, the right group images have asymmetrical or irregular arrangements of crosses and circles, with the circle placed in various positions that create an imbalance or lack of symmetry in the overall composition.
