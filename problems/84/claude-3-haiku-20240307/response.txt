Okay, let's take a close look at the images and describe them in detail.

Left group:
1. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a small square in the center.
2. This image shows a larger circle made up of small dots or circles, with a larger square in the center.
3. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a smaller square in the center.
4. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a larger square in the center.
5. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a smaller square in the center.
6. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a larger square in the center.

Right group:
1. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a small square in the center.
2. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a smaller square in the center.
3. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a larger square in the center.
4. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a smaller square in the center.
5. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a larger square in the center.
6. This image shows a circle made up of small dots or circles, with a smaller square in the center.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is the size of the square in the center of the circle. In the left group, the size of the square varies, while in the right group, the size of the square is either smaller or larger than the square in the left group images.
