Left group:
1. A square shape made of small circles or dots, with a square-shaped hole in the center.
2. Similar to image 1, but with a rectangular-shaped hole in the center instead of a square.
3. Similar pattern of dots, but with a square-shaped hole shifted slightly up and to the left compared to being perfectly centered.
4. Circular pattern of dots with a square-shaped hole in the center, surrounded by a looser, more spread out ring of dots.
5. Grid-like arrangement of dots that fills most of the square image, with a small square-shaped hole near the center.
6. Circular spiral pattern of dots, getting denser towards the center, with a small square-shaped hole in the middle of the spiral.

Right group:
1. Circular arrangement of dots with a square-shaped hole off-center, shifted up and to the right.
2. Square-shaped arrangement of dots with a square-shaped hole shifted down and to the right, almost touching the bottom right corner.
3. Circular arrangement of dots with square-shaped hole shifted to the right side, about halfway between center and edge.
4. Triangular arrangement of dots, with a greater density of dots towards the top, and a square-shaped hole shifted up and to the right.
5. Grid-like square arrangement of dots filling the image, with a square-shaped hole shifted down and to the right of center.
6. Circular spiral of dots with the square-shaped hole shifted right of center along the spiral path.

The key difference I notice between the left and right groups is the position of the square-shaped hole or gap relative to the overall pattern of dots:

In the left group images, the square hole is either perfectly centered, or just slightly off-center, within the dot pattern. The hole remains fully contained inside the dot pattern.

In the right group, the square hole is significantly shifted away from the center, often quite close to the edge of the overall dot pattern. In some cases it is shifted so far, it almost breaks out of the main dot pattern.

So in summary, the left group keeps the hole centered or nearly centered, while the right group has the hole substantially offset from center, often nearly to the perimeter of the dot pattern.

<answer>
In the left group images, the square-shaped hole or gap remains centered or very nearly centered within the overall pattern of dots. 
In the right group images, the square hole is significantly off-center, shifted towards the edge or perimeter of the dot pattern.
