Analyzing the 12 images, I notice that they are divided into two groups - a "left" group and a "right" group. Each group contains 6 images, and I will describe each image in detail.

Left group:
1. This image shows a single, straight, vertical line.
2. This image shows a single, straight, diagonal line pointing slightly upwards.
3. This image shows two straight lines intersecting at an angle, forming an "X" shape.
4. This image shows a single, straight, diagonal line pointing downwards.
5. This image shows a single, curved line in the shape of a "V".
6. This image shows two straight, intersecting lines forming an "A" shape.

Right group:
1. This image shows two straight, intersecting lines forming a triangle.
2. This image shows a single, curved line in the shape of a "W".
3. This image shows three straight lines intersecting to form a star-like shape.
4. This image shows a single, straight, horizontal line.
5. This image shows a single, straight, diagonal line pointing upwards.
6. This image shows a single, curved line in the shape of a "C".

The key difference between the two groups seems to be the complexity and number of lines in each image. The images in the left group generally have fewer and simpler lines, while the images in the right group have more complex arrangements of lines.

Additionally, the left group seems to feature more straight lines, while the right group features more curved lines.

So, the main distinguishing feature between the two groups appears to be the complexity and type of lines (straight vs. curved) present in the images.

The key difference between the two groups of images is the complexity and number of lines present in each image. The images in the left group generally have fewer and simpler lines, with more straight lines, while the images in the right group have more complex arrangements of lines, including more curved lines.
