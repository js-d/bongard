Analyzing the images in the left group:

1. The image shows a single diagonal line that slopes upward from left to right.
2. The image shows multiple diagonal lines of varying lengths sloping upward from left to right.
3. The image shows a V-shaped pattern with the point facing upward.
4. The image shows a triangular shape with the apex pointing upward.
5. The image shows a zigzag pattern with alternating upward and downward slopes.
6. The image shows a vertical line with a triangular shape at the top.

Analyzing the images in the right group:

1. The image shows multiple diagonal lines of varying lengths sloping downward from left to right.
2. The image shows a V-shaped pattern with the point facing downward.
3. The image shows a triangular shape with the apex pointing downward.
4. The image shows a zigzag pattern with alternating upward and downward slopes.
5. The image shows a triangular shape with a horizontal line at the base.
6. The image shows a cross-like pattern with two intersecting diagonal lines.

Comparing the left and right groups:

The main difference between the left and right groups is the overall direction of the shapes and patterns. The images in the left group have shapes and patterns that generally slope upward from left to right, while the images in the right group have shapes and patterns that generally slope downward from left to right.
