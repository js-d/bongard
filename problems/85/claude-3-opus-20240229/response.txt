Left group:
1. A straight line segment with a shorter line segment branching off at an acute angle to the right.
2. A straight line segment with a shorter line segment branching off at an acute angle to the left. The shorter line segment is closer to the top of the main line.
3. Two straight line segments of equal length meeting at an obtuse angle, resembling a wide V shape.
4. A triangle formed by three straight line segments, with the point of the triangle at the bottom.
5. A straight vertical line with a diagonal line branching off about 2/3 of the way up, forming an acute angle and pointing up and to the right.
6. The letter A, formed by two diagonal line segments meeting at an acute angle at the top, with a shorter horizontal line segment connecting them partway down.

Right group:
1. A straight line segment with a shorter line segment branching off at an acute angle to the right. Below this is another straight line segment.
2. The letter M, formed by two longer vertical lines at the sides connected by two diagonal line segments meeting at an obtuse angle in the center.
3. A horizontal line segment with a vertical line segment extending downward from the left end. At the bottom of the vertical segment, a diagonal line segment extends down and to the right.
4. A pentagon shape, formed by three line segments in a triangular arrangement at the top, and two more line segments extending down from the base of the triangle.
5. The letter A, with an additional horizontal line segment below it.
6. An X shape, formed by two diagonal line segments crossing at their midpoints.

The images in the left group all appear to be composed of simple straight line segments, arranged into basic geometric shapes or symbols. None of them have more than 3 separate line segments.

In contrast, the images in the right group are more complex. They contain more line segments arranged into more intricate shapes and symbols, some resembling letters. A few of the right images contain an element from the left group with an additional line or shape added to it.

The key difference seems to be that the right group images are composed of the left group elements combined with additional lines or other left group elements. The left group images are simpler components, while the right group builds more complex shapes from those components.

The images in the left group are composed of simple straight line segments arranged into basic geometric shapes, with no more than 3 line segments each. The images in the right group are more complex, containing more line segments that form intricate shapes and symbols, some resembling letters. The right group images appear to be constructed by combining elements from the left group images with additional lines or shapes. In essence, the left group contains the fundamental building block components, while the right group uses those components to create more elaborate composite structures.
