Left group:
1. A single vertical line.
2. A single diagonal line slanting to the right.
3. A square with a diagonal line through it.
4. Two intersecting diagonal lines forming an X shape.
5. Three wavy lines.
6. A horizontal line with a shorter vertical line intersecting it.

Right group:
1. A single horizontal line.
2. A single diagonal line slanting to the left.
3. A rectangle with a diagonal line through it.
4. Two intersecting horizontal and vertical lines forming a cross shape.
5. Four straight lines forming a square-like shape.
6. A horizontal line with a longer vertical line intersecting it.

The key difference between the left and right groups is the orientation and arrangement of the lines and shapes. The left group consists of more vertical, diagonal, and intersecting lines, while the right group has more horizontal and symmetrical arrangements.

Additionally, the left group has more abstract and irregular shapes, while the right group has more geometric and regular shapes.

<answer>
The difference between the left and right groups is that the left group contains images with more vertical, diagonal, and intersecting lines, as well as more abstract and irregular shapes, while the right group has more horizontal and symmetrical arrangements, as well as more geometric and regular shapes.
