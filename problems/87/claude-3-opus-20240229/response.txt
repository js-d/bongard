Left group:
1. A vertical line with a horizontal line extending to the right at the top.
2. A vertical line with a horizontal line extending to the left at the bottom.
3. A rectangle with no fill.
4. Two diagonal lines crossing to form an X shape.
5. Two diagonal lines meeting at the top to form a wide V or angle shape.
6. A vertical line with a horizontal line extending to the right from the bottom, forming an L shape rotated 180 degrees.

Right group:
1. A horizontal line with a vertical line extending down from the right end.
2. A horizontal line crossing a vertical line near the top, forming a T shape rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
3. A horizontal line crossing a vertical line near the bottom, forming an H shape rotated 90 degrees.
4. Several connected lines forming a zig-zag or N shape rotated 90 degrees.
5. An irregular pentagon shape made of straight lines.
6. A shape resembling a wide, asymmetric M formed by 4 connected line segments.

<thinking>
The left group contains shapes where any horizontal lines connect to vertical lines at their endpoints only. The shapes are open figures or simple crosses/angles.

The right group has shapes where horizontal and vertical lines cross each other at points other than their endpoints, forming intersections and closed shapes or more complex connected figures.

<answer>
The key difference between the left and right groups is that in the left group, horizontal and vertical lines only connect at their endpoints, while in the right group, the lines cross and intersect at points other than the line endpoints, creating more complex closed shapes.
