Okay, let's carefully examine the images in the left and right groups to identify the differences between them.

Left group:
1. This image shows three elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior.
2. This image shows two elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior.
3. This image shows four elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior.
4. This image shows three elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior.
5. This image shows a single, elongated, rounded shape with a dark outline and a lighter interior.
6. This image shows two elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior.

Right group:
1. This image shows three elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior, but they are arranged in a different pattern compared to the left group.
2. This image shows two elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior, but they are arranged in a different pattern compared to the left group.
3. This image shows four elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior, but they are arranged in a different pattern compared to the left group.
4. This image shows three elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior, but they are arranged in a different pattern compared to the left group.
5. This image shows a single, elongated, rounded shape with a dark outline and a lighter interior, but it is positioned differently compared to the left group.
6. This image shows two elongated, rounded shapes with a dark outline and a lighter interior, but they are arranged in a different pattern compared to the left group.

The main difference between the left and right groups is the arrangement and positioning of the elongated, rounded shapes. The shapes themselves are similar, but their arrangement and positioning vary between the two groups.
