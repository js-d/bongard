Left group:
1. Three separate, slightly elongated black shapes of equal size.
2. Two separate black shapes, one larger oval and one smaller circle.
3. Three connected black oval shapes in a row, with the center one slightly larger.
4. Three connected black oval shapes in a row, all the same size.
5. Two equal-sized black ovals connected horizontally, with a third smaller black circle below and centered.
6. Two equal-sized black ovals connected horizontally.

Right group:
1. Five separate black shapes of varying sizes arranged in a cross-like pattern.
2. Four separate black shapes, two larger ovals and two smaller circles, arranged in an alternating pattern.
3. Four separate black shapes, two smaller circles and two larger ovals, arranged with ovals on the outside and circles in the middle.
4. Four separate black shapes forming a square-like arrangement, with ovals in opposite corners.
5. Three separate black oval shapes arranged in a triangular pattern.
6. Four connected black oval shapes in a row.

The key differences I notice between the left and right groups are:
- The left group images contain 2-3 shapes each, while the right group images contain 3-5 shapes each.
- The shapes in the left group are more often connected to each other, while the shapes in the right group are more often separate.
- The left group shapes tend to be arranged linearly in a row, while the right group has more varied arrangements like crosses, alternating patterns, and triangles.
- The left group shapes are more consistently sized, while the right group has more variety in shape sizes within each image.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that the left group images contain simpler arrangements of 2-3 shapes that are more often connected and consistently sized, while the right group images contain more complex arrangements of 3-5 separate shapes in varying sizes and nonlinear patterns.
