Left group:
1. A single large oval shape, and a single small oval shape separated from the larger one.
2. Six oval shapes of equal size arranged in two rows of three.
3. Ten oval shapes total - two rows of four equal-sized ovals at the top, and below them one large oval on the left and one small oval on the right.
4. Five oval shapes total - one large oval and one small oval on the left side, and three equal-sized ovals on the right side vertically arranged.
5. Seven oval shapes total - one small oval in the top left, and below it a group of four equal-sized ovals arranged in a 2x2 square pattern. To the right are two equal-sized ovals vertically arranged.
6. Six oval shapes total - one small oval in the top left, and to its right are four equal-sized ovals arranged in a 2x2 square. Below the small oval is one large oval.

Right group:
1. Five oval shapes total - one small oval on the left, one large oval in the center, and three equal-sized ovals on the right vertically arranged.
2. Ten oval shapes total - one large oval on the left, a group of four equal-sized ovals in a 2x2 square in the center, and on the right side five equal-sized ovals with four arranged in a 2x2 square and one below them in the center.
3. Eleven oval shapes total - a group of four equal-sized ovals in a 2x2 square on the left side. In the center are three equal-sized ovals vertically arranged. On the right are four shapes total - one large oval at the top right and three equal-sized smaller ovals below it vertically arranged.
4. Nine oval shapes total - on the left are two equal-sized ovals vertically arranged. In the center is one large oval shape. On the right are six equal-sized oval shapes with four arranged in a 2x2 square and two below them.
5. Seven oval shapes total arranged symmetrically - one large oval in the center, flanked on both the left and right sides by three equal-sized ovals vertically arranged.
6. Nine oval shapes total arranged symmetrically - in the center are three equal-sized ovals vertically arranged. Flanking them on both the left and right sides are three equal-sized ovals vertically arranged.

The key differences I notice between the left and right groups are:
1. In the left group, when a single small oval appears, it tends to be in the top left or left side of the image. In the right group, single small ovals can appear anywhere.
2. In the left group, large ovals, when they appear, tend to be on the left side or bottom left. In the right group, large ovals can be anywhere.
3. The right group images have more symmetry in the arrangement of the oval shapes. Several have exactly mirrored arrangements on the left and right sides. The left group images are more asymmetrical.
4. The right group tends to have more oval shapes overall per image compared to the left group.

<answer>
The key difference between the images in the left group versus the right group is that the right group images have symmetrical arrangements of the oval shapes, while the left group images have asymmetrical arrangements. In the right group, the ovals are often mirrored on the left and right sides of the image in their positioning. The left group instead has an imbalance, with small single ovals tending to appear in the top/left and large single ovals in the bottom/left, leading to asymmetrical compositions.
