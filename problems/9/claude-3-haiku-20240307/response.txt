To analyze the Bongard problem, I will carefully examine each of the 12 images in the left and right groups, noting their detailed features and differences.

Left group:
1. The image shows a simple black square shape.
2. The image shows a simple black shape that resembles a sideways "L" or a "J" letter.
3. The image shows a simple black shape that resembles a curved "C" or a semicircle.
4. The image shows a simple black shape that resembles a perfect circle.
5. The image shows a simple black shape that resembles a bent or wavy line.
6. The image shows a simple black shape that resembles an equilateral triangle.

Right group:
1. The image shows a complex black shape that resembles a jagged or serrated mountain or wave-like pattern.
2. The image shows a complex black shape that resembles a circular pattern with a series of waves or undulations.
3. The image shows a complex black shape that resembles a circular pattern with a series of wavy lines or curves.
4. The image shows a complex black shape that resembles a circular pattern with a series of jagged or serrated edges.
5. The image shows a complex black shape that resembles a lightning bolt or zig-zag pattern.
6. The image shows a complex black shape that resembles a circular pattern with a series of wavy or undulating lines.

The key difference between the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group are made up of simple, basic geometric shapes like squares, rectangles, circles, and triangles, while the images in the right group are much more complex, consisting of intricate wave-like, jagged, or serrated patterns. The left group shapes are basic and straightforward, while the right group shapes are more abstract and irregular.
