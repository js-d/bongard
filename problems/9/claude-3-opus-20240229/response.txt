<thinking>
The left group contains hollow, unfilled outlines of various shapes. The right group contains closed shapes with jagged, zig-zag edges that have filled interiors. 
The key difference seems to be that shapes in the left group have smooth edges and are unfilled, while shapes in the right group have jagged edges and are filled in.
