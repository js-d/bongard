Left group:
1. Three black rectangular shapes, arranged vertically with space between them.
2. Seven black rectangular shapes, arranged horizontally in a row with no spaces between them.
3. Five black rectangular shapes, arranged with two on top, one in the middle, and two on the bottom forming a plus sign shape.
4. Eight black rectangular shapes, arranged horizontally in a row with no spaces between them.
5. Thirteen black rectangular shapes, arranged horizontally in a row with no spaces between them.
6. Nine black rectangular shapes, arranged with five on top and four on the bottom, forming a rectangle shape with the top row longer than the bottom.

Right group:
1. Four black rectangular shapes, arranged in a 2x2 grid pattern with equal spacing between them.
2. Eight black rectangular shapes, arranged with five on top and three on the bottom, forming an upside-down T shape.
3. Eight black rectangular shapes, arranged with two on the left, four in the middle vertically, and two on the right, forming a capital I shape.
4. Thirteen black rectangular shapes, arranged in a rectangle with the top and bottom rows of five shapes and the middle row of three shapes.
5. Twelve black rectangular shapes, arranged in a rectangle shape with four rows of three shapes each.
6. Eleven black rectangular shapes, arranged with two on top, seven in the middle row, and two on the bottom, forming a capital I shape.

The left group images all contain black rectangular shapes arranged in either a single row or a single column. The right group images contain black rectangular shapes arranged in more complex grid-like or symmetrical patterns with multiple rows and columns.

To determine the key difference, I'll look for a rule that applies to all images in one group but none in the other:

Left 1: Single column
Left 2-5: Single row
Left 6: Two rows, but top row longer so not a grid

Right 1-6: All have multiple rows and columns arranged in a grid-like or symmetrical pattern.

So the distinguishing rule seems to be:
Left: Shapes arranged in a single row, column, or non-grid pattern
Right: Shapes arranged in a grid-like pattern with multiple rows and columns

The key difference between the two groups is:

The left group contains images where the black shapes are arranged in either a single row, a single column, or a non-grid pattern where the rows have unequal numbers of shapes.

The right group contains images where the black shapes are arranged in a grid-like or symmetrical pattern with multiple rows and columns, and each row in a given image has the same number of shapes.
