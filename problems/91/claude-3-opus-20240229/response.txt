Left group:
1. A vertical line with a triangle attached at the top, pointing to the right.
2. Two separate shapes - a square and a rectangle.
3. Three vertical lines or rectangles of equal size, evenly spaced apart.
4. A triangle made of lines, pointing to the right.
5. A circular or curved shape formed by multiple short straight lines connected end to end.
6. A curving line that loops back on itself, with two circles attached at the end.

Right group:
1. A square with a small triangle attached to the top right corner, pointing inward.
2. A branching shape made of four line segments forming three acute angles.
3. Three line segments connected end-to-end, forming two acute angles and pointing down and to the right overall.
4. A square or diamond shape with a cross or plus sign inside it, touching all four sides.
5. Four separate small circular shapes arranged in a square pattern with equal spacing between them.
6. Four identical oval or elongated circular shapes arranged in a square pattern, nearly touching each other.

<thinking>
The left group images all appear to be formed from continuous lines or shapes. Even when there are multiple parts, like the square and rectangle in image 2, they are distinctly separate shapes.

In contrast, the right group images are all composed of multiple line segments or shapes that connect or intersect with each other to form a single composite shape. The parts are joined together rather than separate.

So the key difference seems to be that the left images contain independent, non-intersecting parts, while the right images have interconnected, intersecting elements that form a unified whole.

<answer>
The fundamental difference between the left and right groups is:

The images in the left group are made up of separate, non-intersecting lines or shapes. The components remain independent from each other.

The images in the right group are composed of multiple lines, segments or shapes that intersect and connect with each other, forming a single interconnected figure.
