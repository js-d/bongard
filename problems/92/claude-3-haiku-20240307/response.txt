To analyze the Bongard problem, I will first describe each of the 12 images in detail:

Left group:
1. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a symmetrical 'S' shape pattern.
2. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a symmetrical 'Z' shape pattern.
3. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a symmetrical 'C' shape pattern.
4. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a symmetrical 'U' shape pattern.
5. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a symmetrical 'V' shape pattern.
6. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a symmetrical 'W' shape pattern.

Right group:
1. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a scattered, asymmetrical pattern.
2. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a scattered, asymmetrical pattern.
3. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a scattered, asymmetrical pattern.
4. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a scattered, asymmetrical pattern.
5. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a scattered, asymmetrical pattern.
6. The image shows a collection of circles arranged in a scattered, asymmetrical pattern.

To summarize, the key difference between the left group and the right group is that the images in the left group show a clear, symmetrical pattern in the arrangement of the circles, while the images in the right group show a scattered, asymmetrical arrangement of the circles.
