Left group:
1. A scattered arrangement of black squares and rectangles on a white background, with a single square isolated near the center.
2. Black squares and rectangles dispersed on a white background, with a more even distribution compared to the first image.
3. Black squares and rectangles arranged in a roughly circular pattern on a white background, with some empty space in the center.
4. Black squares and rectangles scattered on a white background, with a denser concentration towards the center and more sparse distribution near the edges.
5. Black squares and rectangles densely packed on a white background, with a slight circular arrangement and a few isolated shapes near the edges.
6. Black squares and rectangles scattered on a white background, with a dense cluster in the center and more isolated shapes towards the bottom right corner.

Right group:
1. Black squares scattered on a white background, with a roughly circular empty space in the center of the arrangement.
2. Black squares dispersed on a white background, with a winding, snake-like empty space running through the center of the arrangement.
3. Black squares scattered on a white background, with a roughly circular empty space slightly off-center in the arrangement.
4. Black squares densely arranged on a white background, with several small, irregular empty spaces distributed throughout the composition.
5. Black squares scattered on a white background, with a large, irregular empty space occupying the center and upper-left portion of the arrangement.
6. Black squares densely packed on a white background, with a few small, circular empty spaces scattered throughout the arrangement, particularly in the lower right corner.

<thinking>
The key difference between the left and right groups appears to be the presence or absence of empty spaces within the arrangements of black shapes.

In the left group, the black squares and rectangles are scattered or arranged without any significant empty spaces between them. The distributions vary from sparse to dense, and some images show circular or clustered patterns, but there are no notable empty regions within the arrangements.

In the right group, each image features one or more empty spaces amidst the black squares. These empty spaces take on various forms, such as roughly circular shapes, winding paths, or irregular regions. The empty spaces are a defining characteristic of the right group, setting them apart from the more uniformly distributed arrangements in the left group.

<answer>
The main difference between the images in the left group and the right group is the presence of empty spaces within the arrangements of black shapes. The left group features scattered or arranged black squares and rectangles without any significant empty spaces, while the right group consistently includes one or more empty regions of varying shapes and sizes amidst the black squares.
