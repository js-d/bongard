Left group:
1. Scattered black shapes, mostly round with a few irregular shapes, on a white background. The shapes are spread out and do not form any clear pattern or structure.
2. Similar to image 1, with scattered black shapes on white, but the shapes are more clustered towards the center of the image. Still no discernible overall pattern.
3. Black shapes on white, with the shapes more evenly distributed compared to images 1 and 2. A few shapes seem to form very small clusters of 2-3 shapes in proximity to each other.
4. A fairly even distribution of black shapes on white. A curving line-like formation can be seen going from the top left to lower right.
5. Black shapes on white with a dense cluster of shapes in the center of the image. Shapes are more sparsely distributed around the edges.
6. A dense, evenly distributed arrangement of black shapes filling most of the white background. The shapes are closer together compared to the other left images.

Right group:
1. Black shapes on a white background, with a triangular or pyramidal arrangement. The shapes are clustered more densely in a roughly triangular region pointing downward from the top center.
2. Black shapes in a curved string-like formation, resembling a crooked or curling line going from left to right across the image on a white background.
3. An intricate, web-like arrangement of black shapes on white. The shapes link together in a complex, branching network structure spanning the image.
4. Black shapes on white forming a looping, pretzel-like knot structure. The shapes link to create a closed, tangled loop.
5. A circular or ring-like arrangement of black shapes on a white background. The shapes are linked into a round, wreath-like structure with a hole in the center.
6. Black shapes arranged in a grid or lattice pattern on white. The shapes connect in horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines forming a regular, crisscrossing mesh structure.

<thinking>
The key differences between the left and right image groups seem to be:

Left images: Scattered, mostly unconnected shapes. Minimal structure or pattern to the arrangements. Shapes are individuals arranged randomly, not linked together.

Right images: Shapes are connected and linked together to form unified structures and patterns. Clear overall arrangement like lines, loops, grids, etc. Shapes join to create larger composite forms.

So in summary, the left images contain unlinked, scattered individual shapes, while the right images have shapes connecting to form structural patterns and networks.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right image groups is that the left images contain individual, unconnected shapes scattered randomly without forming overall patterns, while the shapes in the right images link together into unified structural arrangements like lines, loops, webs, and grids. The left group lacks clear organization, whereas the right group has the shapes joining to create distinct composite forms and regular patterns spanning each image.
