Okay, let's analyze the images in detail.

Left group:
1. This image shows a series of 8 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
2. This image shows a series of 10 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
3. This image shows a series of 8 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
4. This image shows a series of 10 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
5. This image shows a series of 8 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
6. This image shows a series of 10 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.

Right group:
1. This image shows a series of 7 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
2. This image shows a series of 9 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
3. This image shows a series of 7 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
4. This image shows a series of 9 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
5. This image shows a series of 7 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.
6. This image shows a series of 9 circular shapes arranged in a horizontal line. The shapes alternate between solid black circles and hollow circles.

The main difference between the left group and the right group is the number of circular shapes in each image. The images in the left group have either 8 or 10 circular shapes, while the images in the right group have either 7 or 9 circular shapes.
