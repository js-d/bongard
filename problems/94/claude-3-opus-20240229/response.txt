Left group:
1. A sequence of black octagonal shapes forming a curved line, with the size of the octagons decreasing from left to right.
2. A small black octagon connected to a larger curved sequence of black octagons, forming a J-like shape.
3. A cross-like shape made of black octagons, with a single octagon at the center and 4 arms each consisting of 2 octagons extending from the center.
4. A Y-shaped structure made of black octagons, with a long stem of octagons and two shorter arms branching off near the top, each made of 2 octagons.
5. A T-shaped structure made of black octagons, with a horizontal crossbar of 5 octagons and a vertical stem extending down from the center octagon of the crossbar.
6. A curved U-like shape made of black octagons, with the arms of the U curving inward slightly.

Right group:
1. An S-like curved shape made of black octagons, with a small cluster of 3 octagons at one end.
2. A straight line of 7 black octagons with no curvature or branching.
3. An O-like shape made of black octagons, not fully closed, with a single octagon protruding from the lower right side.
4. A branching structure made of black octagons, with a Y-like shape at the top and an extra arm curving down and to the right from the bottom of the Y.
5. A complex branching structure of black octagons, with a stem curving to the left and multiple branches extending up and down from the right side of the stem.
6. A J-like curved shape made of black octagons, with a straight stem and a curved hook at the top, and a single disconnected octagon floating above the hook.

<thinking>
The left group images all seem to be connected, continuous shapes made of octagons, without any disconnected parts. The shapes include lines, curves, and branching structures.

The right group images, in contrast, all have at least one disconnected or floating octagon separate from the main shape. The main shapes themselves also seem to include more complex curves and branching compared to the left group.

So the key difference appears to be that the left group shapes are fully connected, while the right group shapes contain disconnected floating octagons.

<answer>
The main difference between the left and right groups is that all shapes in the left group are continuous and fully connected, while each shape in the right group contains at least one disconnected or floating octagon separate from the main body of the shape.
