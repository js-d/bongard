Analyzing the images in the 'left' group:

1. The image is a triangular shape with a series of jagged diagonal lines forming the sides.
2. The image consists of a series of vertical bars or lines of varying lengths.
3. The image is an oval shape with a series of vertical lines or bars running through the center.
4. The image is a diamond shape with a series of diagonal lines forming the sides.
5. The image is a triangular shape with a series of vertical lines or bars forming the sides.
6. The image is a triangular shape with a series of diagonal lines forming the sides.

Analyzing the images in the 'right' group:

1. The image consists of a series of diagonal lines or bars of varying lengths.
2. The image is a circular shape with a series of horizontal lines or bars running through the center.
3. The image is a heart shape with a series of horizontal lines or bars running through the center.
4. The image is a triangular shape with a series of horizontal lines or bars forming the sides.
5. The image is a square shape with a series of horizontal lines or bars forming the sides.
6. The image is an oval shape with a series of horizontal lines or bars running through the center.

The key difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group is the orientation of the lines or bars. In the 'left' group, the lines or bars are primarily diagonal or vertical, while in the 'right' group, the lines or bars are primarily horizontal.
