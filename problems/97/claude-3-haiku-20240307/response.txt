Okay, let's analyze the images in detail:

Left group:
1. This image shows a simple black equilateral triangle.
2. This image shows a series of circles arranged in a triangular pattern.
3. This image shows a series of dashed lines forming a triangular shape.
4. This image shows a solid black equilateral triangle.
5. This image shows a series of short line segments arranged in a triangular pattern.
6. This image shows a series of small dots arranged in a triangular pattern.

Right group:
1. This image shows a simple black circle.
2. This image shows a series of triangles arranged in a triangular pattern.
3. This image shows a series of dashed lines forming a square shape.
4. This image shows a solid black triangle pointing downwards.
5. This image shows a series of long line segments arranged in a radial pattern.
6. This image shows a series of small dots arranged in a circular pattern.

The key difference between the left group and the right group seems to be the overall shape being depicted - the left group all show triangular shapes, while the right group shows a mix of circular and square shapes. Additionally, the patterns and arrangements within the shapes differ between the two groups.

<answer>
The left group of images all depict various triangular shapes, while the right group depicts a mix of circular and square shapes. The left group includes simple solid triangles, triangular arrangements of circles, dashed lines, short line segments, and dots. In contrast, the right group includes a circle, a triangular arrangement of triangles, a square made of dashed lines, a downward-pointing triangle, a radial arrangement of line segments, and a circular arrangement of dots.
