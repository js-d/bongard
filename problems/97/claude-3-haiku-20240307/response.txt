To describe the images in the left group:

Left group:
1. A simple black triangle pointing downwards.
2. A pattern of white circles arranged in a triangular shape.
3. A jagged, zig-zag pattern of black lines pointing upwards.
4. A solid black triangular shape.
5. A pattern of black lines arranged in a triangular shape, with the lines becoming more dense towards the top.
6. A scattered pattern of black dots forming a triangular shape.

To describe the images in the right group:

Right group:
1. A simple black circle.
2. A circular arrangement of black triangular shapes.
3. A radial pattern of black lines emanating from a central point.
4. A circular shape with a repeating pattern of smaller circles inside.
5. A circular pattern of black dots.
6. A solid black circular shape.

To explain the difference between the left and right groups:

The key difference between the left and right groups is that the images in the left group all feature some form of triangular shape, while the images in the right group all feature some form of circular shape. The triangular shapes in the left group vary in their specific patterns and arrangements, but they all share the common characteristic of being triangular. Similarly, the circular shapes in the right group vary in their specific patterns and arrangements, but they all share the common characteristic of being circular.
