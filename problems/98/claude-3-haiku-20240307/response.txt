To analyze the Bongard problem, I will first describe each of the 12 images in detail, looking closely at the various elements and patterns present in them.

Left group:
1. This image appears to be a grid of black and white squares, with a large, irregular black shape occupying a significant portion of the grid.
2. This image shows a grid of black and white squares, with several diagonal and curved lines intersecting and creating a complex, abstract pattern.
3. This image depicts a grid of black and white squares, with a large, triangular black shape occupying the center.
4. This image consists of a grid of black and white squares, with several intersecting lines and curves forming an intricate, organic-looking pattern.
5. This image shows a grid of black and white squares, with a large, rectangular black shape positioned diagonally across the grid.
6. This image presents a grid of black and white squares, with a series of curved, overlapping lines creating a dynamic, abstract design.

Right group:
1. This image features a grid of black and white squares, with a large, irregular black shape occupying the center and various smaller black shapes scattered throughout.
2. This image depicts a grid of black and white squares, with a single, elongated black shape extending across the center.
3. This image shows a grid of black and white squares, with a rectangular black shape positioned in the center and several smaller black shapes surrounding it.
4. This image consists of a grid of black and white squares, with a large, intricate black shape composed of several intersecting lines and curves.
5. This image presents a grid of black and white squares, with a rectangular black shape occupying the center and several smaller black shapes dispersed throughout.
6. This image displays a grid of black and white squares, with a rectangular black shape in the center and a complex pattern of intersecting lines and curves surrounding it.

Analyzing the differences between the left and right groups, the key distinction appears to be the complexity and arrangement of the shapes within the grid. The images in the left group generally feature simpler, more geometric black shapes, while the right group contains more intricate, organic-looking black shapes that often span multiple grid cells. Additionally, the shapes in the left group tend to be more centralized or occupy a larger area, whereas the right group has a more distributed arrangement of shapes.

<answer>
The key difference between the 'left' group and the 'right' group of images is the complexity and arrangement of the black shapes within the grid. The 'left' group contains simpler, more geometric black shapes that are often centralized or occupy a larger area of the grid, while the 'right' group features more intricate, organic-looking black shapes that are more distributed throughout the grid and span multiple cells.
