Let me analyze each of the 12 images in detail:

Left group:
1. The image shows a grid-like pattern with a curved, asymmetrical shape in the center. The shape is formed by intersecting lines that create an irregular, looping structure.
2. The image has a grid-like pattern with a triangular shape in the center. The triangle is formed by intersecting lines that create a symmetrical, sharp-edged structure.
3. The image has a grid-like pattern with a rectangular shape in the center. The shape is formed by intersecting lines that create a symmetrical, straight-edged structure.
4. The image has a grid-like pattern with an irregular, jagged shape in the center. The shape is formed by intersecting lines that create an asymmetrical, complex structure.
5. The image has a grid-like pattern with a circular shape in the center. The shape is formed by intersecting lines that create a symmetrical, smooth-edged structure.
6. The image has a grid-like pattern with a diamond-like shape in the center. The shape is formed by intersecting lines that create a symmetrical, pointed structure.

Right group:
1. The image shows a grid-like pattern with a straight, horizontal line in the center.
2. The image has a grid-like pattern with a straight, vertical line in the center.
3. The image has a grid-like pattern with a diagonal line in the center.
4. The image has a grid-like pattern with a zigzag-like line in the center.
5. The image has a grid-like pattern with a wavy line in the center.
6. The image has a grid-like pattern with a single, centrally-placed diamond shape.

The main difference between the images in the left group and the images in the right group is the complexity and symmetry of the central shapes. The left group images have more complex, irregular, and asymmetrical shapes, while the right group images have simpler, more symmetrical, and geometric shapes. The left group images also have a more intricate and intersecting line pattern, while the right group images have a cleaner, more uniform line pattern.

<answer>
The left group images contain more complex, irregular, and asymmetrical shapes in the center, while the right group images have simpler, more symmetrical, and geometric shapes in the center. The left group images also have a more intricate and intersecting line pattern, while the right group images have a cleaner, more uniform line pattern.
