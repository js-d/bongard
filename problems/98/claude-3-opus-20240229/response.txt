Left group:
1. A grid of squares with a jagged black line running diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, staying within the grid lines.
2. A grid of squares with a jagged black line running diagonally from the bottom left to the top right, staying within the grid lines.
3. A grid of squares with jagged black lines forming an "X" shape, with both lines staying within the grid lines.
4. A grid of squares with jagged black lines forming a rough triangle shape, with all lines staying within the grid lines.
5. A grid of squares with a complex pattern of jagged black lines that resemble a cracked surface or shattered glass, staying within the grid lines.
6. A grid of squares with a six-pointed star shape formed by jagged black lines, staying within the grid lines.

Right group:
1. A grid of squares with a jagged black line running diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, crossing over grid lines in some places.
2. A grid of squares with jagged black lines forming a rough loop or circular shape, crossing over grid lines.
3. A grid of squares with jagged black lines forming a rough rectangular shape, crossing over grid lines.
4. A grid of squares with a single square shape outlined by a black border, not conforming to the grid lines.
5. A grid of squares with a checkerboard pattern of alternating black and white squares, not conforming to the provided grid lines.
6. A single black diamond shape on a white background, not on a grid.

<thinking>
The key difference between the two groups seems to be that in the left group, all the black lines and shapes conform to and stay within the grid lines of the square grid. The lines and shapes are jagged but never cross over the grid boundaries.

In contrast, the right group contains images where the black lines, shapes, and patterns do not conform to the grid lines. They cross over and ignore the grid boundaries. Some images in the right group don't even have a grid.

So in summary, the left group follows the grid, while the right group does not follow the grid. That appears to be the main distinguishing rule between the two sets of images.

<answer>
The images in the left group all contain black lines and shapes that conform to and stay within the boundaries of the square grid lines, never crossing over them, even though the lines are jagged and irregular.

The images in the right group contain black lines, shapes, and patterns that do not conform to or stay within the square grid lines, often crossing over the grid boundaries. Some images in this group do not have a grid structure at all.
