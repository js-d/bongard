Left group:
1. A scattered arrangement of black triangular and circular shapes on a white background, with more triangles than circles. The shapes are spread out fairly evenly across the image.
2. Another scattered arrangement of black triangular and circular shapes on white, similar to the first image. The triangles and circles are distributed across the full image.
3. Black triangular and circular shapes on white, with the shapes more concentrated in the center of the image compared to the previous two. There are more triangles than circles.
4. A denser clustering of black triangular and circular shapes, concentrated more in a circular region in the center. The outer edges have fewer shapes. Triangles outnumber circles.
5. Black triangular and circular shapes densely packed to fill most of the image area. Triangles are more numerous than the circles.
6. A very dense packing of many small black triangular and circular shapes filling nearly the entire image. Triangles appear more numerous than circles.

Right group:
1. A scattered arrangement of black triangular and circular shapes on white, with triangles and circles in roughly equal proportion. The shapes are spread out across the image.
2. Black triangular and circular shapes scattered across a white background. Triangles and circles are present in similar numbers and distributed throughout the image.
3. A sparser arrangement of black triangular and circular shapes, with more whitespace visible compared to the previous right images. Triangles and circles occur in balanced proportion.
4. Black triangular and circular shapes on white, slightly more densely clustered in the center but still plenty of whitespace around the perimeter. Triangles and circles appear equal in number.
5. Triangular and circular black shapes scattered across the entire rectangular image. The density is moderate, not too sparse or crowded. Balance between triangles and circles.
6. A fairly uniform distribution of black triangular and circular shapes on the white background. No dense clustering. Triangles and circles are represented in approximately equal quantities.

<thinking>
The left images tend to have:
- More triangular shapes compared to circular ones
- Denser clustering of shapes, especially concentrated in the center
- Less whitespace visible, shapes cover more of the image area

The right images have:
- Roughly equal numbers of triangles and circles
- More uniform, evenly spaced distributions of shapes
- No dense central clustering, more whitespace around shapes

So in summary, the key differences are the left images have a higher ratio of triangles to circles and exhibit denser clustering, while the right images balance triangles and circles and have sparser, more evenly distributed shapes.

<answer>
The main differences between the left and right groups are:

1. Shape ratio: The left images contain more triangular shapes compared to circles, while the right images have approximately equal numbers of triangles and circles.

2. Distribution: The left images tend to have the shapes clustered more densely, especially concentrated in the center of the frame. The right images show the shapes more evenly scattered throughout with less central density.

3. Spacing: Less whitespace is visible in the left images as the shapes cover more of the image area, particularly in the later images. The right images consistently have more uniform spacing between shapes and more visible background around the perimeter.
